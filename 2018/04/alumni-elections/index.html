      <h1>Penn Alumni Candidates</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>This primary season, 19 Penn alumni have joined in congressional and senatorial races around the country. These alumni hail from 10 states, span three parties, and are running for both House and Senate seats.</p>
        <p>Seven of these candidates are running in Pennsylvania. While five alumni are incumbent nominees, the remaining 14 are either running for the very first time or currently serve a position in state and local government.</p>
        <p>The primary elections in Pennsylvania for the 2018 midterms are on May 15, and the midterms themselves are on November 6. These midterms promise to be competitive, and many experts think that Democrats may see more success than they have in recent elections. While Donald Trump may be Pennâ€™s most famous current politician, come this November several more former Quakers may be making their mark on the American political landscape.</p>
