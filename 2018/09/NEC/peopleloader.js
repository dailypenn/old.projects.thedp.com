        'statement': "Hey Penn! My name is Alexis Calin, and I’m super excited to be running for UA New Student Representative. I’ve been involved in student government my whole life, and I am looking forward to sharing my passion for Penn with you all.<br><br>I love everything that Penn has to offer, and I am confident that I have skills necessary to make it an even more welcoming community. My first step would be to foster a better relationship between the Undergraduate Assembly and the student body. It is the student body’s right to be informed about our initiatives, our successes, and even our failures; therefore, I am proposing a less formal mechanism for voicing your opinions. I hope to organize events where we can hang out, get to know each other, and be transparent about what we love (and don’t love) about Penn. In addition, I hope to continue working on the initiative to create a more friendly interface for PennInTouch and CampusExpress. Lastly, I want to improve opportunities for freshmen living in four-year housing communities to ensure that everyone has an unforgettable freshman year!<br><br>Thanks for all your support, and I look forward to meeting each and everyone of you!",

        'statement': "Hi everyone! My name is Bernadette Breslin, but most people know me as “Bern.” I’m a freshman living in Hill and am enrolled in the College. I see myself as a people person which is why I’m planning to major in Communications with a focus in broadcast journalism. I aspire to be a news anchor which would be pretty entertaining for viewers considering my Philly accent is stronger than most. With that said, I can promise you that this accent will be a voice for you. As a UA representative, I’m hoping to implement changes that will benefit not just the class of 2022, but Penn as a whole. For starters, I would split the Student Activities fair into two days instead of one. I would also promote more integration between college houses to encourage friendship diversity and help improve our meal plans by increasing the number of places that accept dining dollars. If voted onto the UA, I would propose to have dining dollars and Penn cash be interchangeable, so that students can print and buy food using money from one central account. Thank you for your support, and please remember Bern Breslin on the ballot when voting!",

I also have ideas for policies I will push for to solve these challenges.  As someone with extensive advocacy and policy building experience from serving on my high school’s Principal’s Advisory Board, I am well versed in negotiations with school administration.  I hope to use my knowledge to serve our class and enhance your undergraduate experience at Penn.  In particular, I am looking to join the Dining, Housing, and Transit committee as the majority of freshman interests lie in this area, so that I can express our concerns and propose reforms.  I would also like to conduct in-depth research into funding allocations for student groups so that I can ensure that every dollar is spent with purpose and more funding goes towards activities and events that our class enjoys.<br><br>VOTE BHAVYA SHAH for UA representative &mdash; A vision.

In what has now surprisingly been a full month on campus, I’ve gotten the chance to meet many of you already as well as hear your opinions on what you’d like to be changed. Why is it that some dining halls charge extra to takeout meals if you need to eat on the go? We all know we have to save those extra few bucks for a night out at Allegro. Clubs seem fun and all until you find out they require multiple 250 word essays and 2 rounds of interviews; I look want to work with you all to change that.

In the same vain, I would work to minimize the stress of the club fair by compiling each club's first GBM time and location into one document to be sent out to all students, that way you don't miss out on some clubs you want to join. Another gap in communication I would like to fix is the emails about each day of events during NSO. If they are sent out earlier, around 6pm the night before, it would allow you adequate time to plan each day and maximize usage of NSO programming. And most of all, I want to hear about your experiences through regular surveys sent out to check in and see what you think can be improved around campus.",

Furthermore, I would advocate for policies limiting the intensity of club recruitment processes. Many new students are overwhelmed by the large quantity of competitive applications and interview rounds they must complete while adjusting to life at Penn. In additional to mental health, physical health is very important to me; I believe restrooms around campus must provide free menstrual health necessities. In essence, my actions would reflect the interests of the student body at large by considering pressing issues (including the lack of drainage on Locust Walk so we don’t need Noah’s Ark to get to class when it rains)!",

Secondly, I’d like for the new Undergraduate Assembly Sustainability Committee to host the many campus sustainability groups in a conference where all the groups will work together to construct a comprehensive and feasible action plan focused on making our campus more environmentally-friendly; from extensive background in proposing/lobbying, it is significantly harder for any administration to ignore a united call from 6 groups, compared to many individual requests. Lastly, while proposed with good intent, I’d like to champion for increased wellness alternatives specifically for freshmen, in exchange for Huntsman Hall reverting to its original operating hours. Everyone uses Huntsman, and by closing earlier, more students will be relegated to cramped dorm lounges and basement study rooms.",

Attending Penn with my twin brother, Max, has been a great decision and by running for co-chairs, we want to bring family to the College.<br><br>I have three ideas for how to achieve this. First, in collaboration with student clubs and cultural centers, I will organize meaningful events for our whole grade. Second, I will establish “College Cohorts.” Similar to Wharton, these groups will unite students through dinners and competitions. These events will facilitate opportunities for students to get to know one another better and increase a sense of community. Third, create a student committee, which will include more people in the planning and decision-making process and enhance the reach and excitement for our events. #2Twins2Votes",

Before I explain what that is, I’d like to thank you guys for those petition signatures (hopefully the soliciting didn’t get too annoying!).<br><br>As College Chair, I plan to focus on improving the cohesiveness among the College students. I remember the awkwardness of my first week (“Where are you from? Where are you staying?”) and the difficulty of finding people I knew at Hill--and I’m sure it’s the same for some of you. That's why my first idea is an event that would allow freshmen to meet their peers by signing up to meet at a dining hall for lunch one day.<br><br>It’s only been a few weeks, but we already have a lot on our plates. For those of you who prioritize everything perfectly (I admire you), here’s my second idea: a social volunteering project for the Class of ‘22. We can get together for a night of hot chocolate and assemble care packages, for a socializing event that’s also meaningful.<br><br>Of course, YOUR ideas are also important to me!

I decided to run for Engineering Chair to promote inclusivity as a community and push for events that will allow us to not only come together as fellow engineering students, but also most importantly to come together as a Penn Engineering family. My position on the board will allow me to propose the execution of these events and I will always be open to new ideas in which we can improve our community.
