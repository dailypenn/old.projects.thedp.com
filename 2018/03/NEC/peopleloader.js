Additionally, I served on the UA’s Budget Committee and have supported a number of UA mental wellness initiatives. In running for reelection, I would like to continue working on similar projects and contribute to making Penn’s community a better place, and I believe that I have proven myself capable of doing that this past year. As for my candidacy for College Chair, I believe that I can bring a creative attitude to Class Board 2020 in using the budget efficiently to plan events that the class can enjoy. Additionally, being a member of both Class Board and UA would allow me to ensure that there exists dialogue between the two branches regarding budget use and allocation.

Over the past year, I increased transparency for the Undergraduate Assembly by facilitating the creation of summaries for each UA GBM along with publicizing a google form to provide problems you want solved directly to the UA. I worked towards making it easier to audit courses and preventing classes from becoming overbooked (let’s agree, the floor does not count as a desk). I lobbied for increased access to water fountains while working to strengthen composting on campus. I pressed for increased sustainability on campus by facilitating discussion on environmental topics, elevating the level of communication between the UA and the environmental community, and meetings with Penn administrators.

While it’s extremely important to acknowledge and normalize both the existence and prevalence of mental health issues on campus, it’s equally as important to find practical ways to combat their underlying causes. In the academic department, for example, some projects I plan to continue or propose are: mandating professors return at least one graded assignment prior to the drop deadline (for classes in which this is possible), increasing study resources for College students such as all-school printing in Huntsman, implementing a technology equipment borrowing system such as Weiss Media Lab in other on-campus study spaces, and more. In the student life department, I wish to advocate for an increase in reading days similar to our peer Ivy League institutions, and longer breaks from school. Moreover, I wish to serve as a voice for all underrepresented minority students on campus, and advocate for issues pertaining to both their communities, and those of all other marginalized groups, including first-generation and low-income.",

I will work to bridge the gap between women in engineering and women in the STEM field, to create a large network for all women in different scientific disciplines at Penn. One thing that I notice among engineering students is that the close knit community within the different majors does not transfer to a larger sense of community among all students in SEAS &mdash; between class years or the individual majors/programs within the years. I will use my platform to plan events/activities that will bring together SEAS as a whole, such as subsidized tickets to Philadelphia sporting events or something as simple as a Junior (or freshmen/sophomore) night at the ice skating rink on campus.",

I strive to do this by making people happy by connecting them to the underlying traditions that define Penn. My platform is simple: it consists of the three interconnected ideas of Inclusion, Expansion, and Collaboration. By Inclusion I mean catering to the hundreds of ethnicities and nationalities at Penn as many students feel left out at times during Penn traditions and events. How will we remedy this? Expansion: creating new and innovative events that expand on current Penn traditions to make them bigger, better, and more inclusive. Another part of Inclusion is Socio-Economic Inclusion. For example, last year we covered 100% of requested financial aid for Harry Potter shirts. How? Via Collaboration with different organizations on campus such as Penn Alumni, Penn Traditions, Student Financial Services, the UA and more.",

As an international and FGLI student in SEAS, I am very well aware how one’s mental health can be negatively impacted at Penn. Being in an engineering major leaves no time to deal with homesickness, gives no time to adjust to a new place and a new culture and makes it incredibly hard to juggle work-study with classes and clubs. Through some of my ideas and your suggestions, I would like to improve mental health in SEAS. I would like to organize events that would help break the stigma of mental health, workshops that would help students better navigate their engineering career and puppy study breaks in the e-quad! Lastly, I would strongly like to support our female engineering students by increasing the awareness of discriminatory behaviors such as mansplaining and hepeating.

        'statement': "Hi everyone! I’m Arjun Swaminathan and I’m running to be reelected to UA as an SAS representative and elected to Class Board 2020 as College Chair. As a member of the UA this year, I have been responsible for a number of dining, sustainability, and facilities projects that have promoted a healthy and wholesome lifestyle on campus, ranging from renovation of water dispensers in various buildings to advertising dining hall hours during finals. Additionally, I served on the UA’s Budget Committee and have supported a number of UA mental wellness initiatives. In running for reelection, I would like to continue working on similar projects and contribute to making Penn’s community a better place, and I believe that I have proven myself capable of doing that this past year. As for my candidacy for College Chair, I believe that I can bring a creative attitude to Class Board 2020 in using the budget efficiently to plan events that the class can enjoy. Additionally, being a member of both Class Board and UA would allow me to ensure that there exists dialogue between the two branches regarding budget use and allocation. Thanks for reading and vote for Arjun!",

Expansion: creating new and innovative events that expand on current Penn traditions to make them bigger, better, and more inclusive. Another part of Inclusion is Socio-Economic Inclusion.

        'statement': "As a Comp Sci major and passionate member of Penn Electric Racing's Software team, I know how it feels to be completely CLUELESS when it comes to class selection, internships, and life at Penn in general. This is why I am focusing my campaign on accessibility and integration, both within the School of Engineering and throughout the Penn community as a whole. School is already hard enough, why stress over all of the extra stuff when you could have someone helping you along the way instead?<br><br>If I have the honor of being elected, I plan to immediately establish a unanimous, online way for all freshman Engineers to directly and privately address me with suggestions, concerns, or questions about anything Penn related (or not).  I’m here to listen, and I’m here to make change.<br><br>For all of you amazing people that I've already talked to, and for the many more that I look forward to meeting, I can't wait to make your voices heard and make the School of Engineering and Applied Science exactly the place you want it to be!<br><br>Vote Steven Shapiro for SEAS Class Chair!",

        'statement': "Hello fellow Wharton freshman! My name is Jay Mudholkar, and I’m running for re-election as Wharton Chair on Class Board for the Class of 2021. After having been elected as Wharton Chair back in the fall thanks to you all, I have proudly represented the Wharton Undergraduate freshman class on Class Board and have worked with a group of extremely dedicated people to plan some incredible events. From Econ Scream to our Thankful Banner to our Merch Madness giveaways to our Harry Potter School shirts, it's been so fun to see how we have had an impact on Penn freshman, and I am so glad that I was able to play a direct role in all of that. To me though, Class Board has also given me the chance to meet some of my closest friends, and I have had a dope time through it all: I am excited to be running again. Re-elect Jay for Wharton Chair 2021!",

Events such as econ scream, cram and jam, and merch madness have brought the nursing class closer to the other schools on campus and I hope to continue this for years to come. As the Nursing Chair for the Class of 2021, I will continue to make sure that the small yet mighty nursing class has a voice on campus.
