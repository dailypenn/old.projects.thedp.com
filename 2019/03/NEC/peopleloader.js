An overarching theme is student engagement, and as President I want to continue to build on forums like UA Steering, town halls and focus groups, to enhance collaboration among student leaders, and move from discussions to tangible actions items with administration.<br><br>Our record shows this works. From directly working with administrators on the creation of the new PennTransit-App that allows students to request transportation on and off-campus for free, to personally creating 360°-Views of Campus Dorms for Campus-Express, to implementing new signage in all Dining Halls on sustainable food disposal, and developing mindfulness-spaces in centralized locations like Houston Hall, I will continue to lead the UA to tangible change for you as UA President.",

As the chair of the United Minorities Council, I led the effort in increasing funding for all cultural groups by securing a $6000 annual allocation for 6B as well as the push for the expansion of minority spaces on campus beyond the basement of Arch. I am also pursuing the creation of a University-wide policy mandating professors to give students make-up midterms in case of legitimate absences due to illness, family emergency, religious reasons, or other unexpected events. The embedded CAPS model I championed for freshmen year is also currently expanding across campus, piloted by Wharton but spreading to other schools as well. All of my initiatives focus on hearing all voices on campus, understanding diverse student needs, and creating tangible changes in response. It is the responsibility of the UA to ensure all students are having the best Penn experiences possible, and to that I say “Yes We Kev”.',

The UA is seen as an organization that is more concerned about airport shuttle sales than the advocacy of the student body. I want to ensure that the student body knows that is false with periodical publications of the UA's projects roughly 4 times a school year and by widely disseminating a UA feedback form, so students know that the UA actually works for them. Moreover, I would like to advocate for all students to have equal access at Penn, which is not the case.

For the past year, I’ve been fortunate enough to serve as an Associate Member on the Undergraduate Assembly. My chief focus has been to integrate wellness into university life (mainly through the expansion of the Embedded CAPS Model that has been implemented in Wharton) because at Penn, we tend to see ourselves as students first and people second. To combat this culture, I believe that wellness must be tailored to us and made equally accessible. The UA has also afforded me the opportunity to advocate for members of underrepresented groups on campus. I’ve worked alongside the Cultural Resource Centers to plan programming that celebrates student diversity and engineered solutions to challenges faced by the FGLI community. Most importantly, I’ve worked to realize that my voice, as that of a minority and FGLI student, demands to be heard. A vote for Mary is a vote that carries the weight of making all-inclusive change.

I want to thank everyone for the experiences that have been granted to me, but I've come one last time for your help. Once again, it is election season, and I want your help in re-electing me once again to the Penn Undergraduate Assembly as a School of Arts and Science Representative.<br><br>Since I’ve joined the UA, I’ve worked on projects such as Fall and Spring Wellness Week, creating a UA/CAPS Advisory Board Liaison, passing Wellness Resources on Syllabi to the Faculty Senate, creating and updating the Penn Resource Wellness Guide, and working on the Penn Big Idea Project to promote wellness throughout the Penn Community. I want to continue working on these types of projects, and do what I can to improve all types of wellness at Penn, not just mental or physical. In the next year, I plan to work with other student organizations such as Penn Wellness to truly create a more cohesive alliance that focuses on tackling the problem of Wellness at Penn.<br><br>I love this community, and can't wait to serve it again.

Implementing policies helping students understand their carbon footprint as well as becoming a more eco-cognizant establishment are critical.",

You can see from my track record that I am committed to implementing my platform and making sure everyone has access to a great Penn experience regardless of who they are or where they come from.<br><br>For the last two years, I’ve been pushing the boundaries of what Class Board can do for all of us students, and what’s coming is even greater.<br><br>My platform is simple: it consists of the three interconnected ideas of Inclusion, Expansion, and Collaboration. I’ve delivered on that platform in every way I could: I’ve pushed to subsidize 100% of Quarter zips and costs for Class Board events for all students requesting financial aid. Moreover, I’ve been an integral part of planning the Sophomore experience, from Sophomore week, to larger events like Holi.<br><br> Finally, I’ve worked to increase Class Board’s collaboration with different business in Philly to provide us with amazing events: United by Blue, Federal Donuts, Hummus Grill, Zahav and many more for our restaurant Crawls, Blind Brunches, and Coffee House events.",

As a holder of a dual citizenship between the United States and Lebanon you can trust that I have a variety of perspectives on the world and people.

As Vice President Internal, I would work to serve not only you, but the entirety of the class of 2022. I plan to (I) design an event that commemorates when we declare our majors and, thus, begin to truly follow our passions for the rest of our undergraduate years, (II) incorporate one-on-one coffee chats with class board members to facilitate transparency, communication, and our relationships with you, and (III) help organize class-wide events, such as free brunch and dinners that help us all grow together as a whole.<br><br>As a previous class president, and an extremely motivated and outspoken student, I am not one to back down from a challenge; rather, I am able to look to the future and make the necessary changes. We all hold the power to decide the future. Let’s #maketarightchoice and work together to make our sophomore year ta-rrific!",

Class of 2022, I have a simple question for you: why try to fix something that ain’t broke when we can come together to build something special ourselves? All of these amazing Penn landmark events were started by students just like you and me. If we can unite as a class, there’s no reason why students years from now will be platforming on the tradition WE, the CLASS OF 2022, built from the ground up. As VP of Internal Affairs, I plan to facilitate such class spirit through programs and initiatives while ensuring that we as student leadership accurately reflect all of you - that’s why I’m campaigning on #VoicesOf22. I’ve enjoyed countless conversation with so many of you over the past few weeks, and I’m honored to be considered for this position with so many great candidates. Happy voting!",
