			<span class="dropcap">O</span>n Halloween weekend,
		Rodin College House's water system offered far more tricks than treats.

		</p>
		<p>
			At 11:09 a.m. on Oct.
		31, residents were notified by an email from Associate Director of Strategic
		Planning at Residential and Hospitality Services Nathan Cockrum that water had
		been cut off in rooms ending in -11 due to "a significant leak." By 10:23 p.m.,
		rooms ending in -12 also lost water.

		</p>
		<p>
			The next day at 9:57
		a.m., water shut off in rooms ending in -13 as well. "We are going backwards in
		our efforts," Cockrum wrote. Eleven minutes later, things got even worse.

		</p>
		<p>
			"Unexpectedly we are experiencing a building
		wide hot water outage," Cockrum wrote.

		</p>
		<p>
			Hot water was finally
		restored at 2:05 p.m., capping off a 27-hour odyssey of increasing frantic emails,
		water shortages and reversals.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			During the late fall and early winter months, leaks, water
		outages and broken radiators are regular complaints in the Penn College
		House system due to the frequency of broken and frozen pipes.

		</p>
		<p>
			This past month alone,
		Rodin and Harnwell College Houses were affected by multiple water shortages &mdash;
		including, most severely, water from a sewage leak dripping into Harnwell's
		mezzanine.
		</p>

		</p>
		<p>
			These frequent mishaps &mdash; usually written off in emails to
		residents as the fault of a leaky valve or broken pipe &mdash; are endemic to a
		broader neglect of infrastructure within college houses, according to
		interviews with 10 FRES workers, some with decades of experience responding
		to maintenance requests from students.

		</p>
		<p>
			The high rises undergo
		frequent water shortages, the employees said, because Penn installed a cheap,
		inefficient water heating system that was ill-fit for a building where
		residents often shower at similar times. Despite cyclical problems with water
		shortages and frequent staff complaints, the same inefficient water ventilation
		system was put into each high-rise building. The employees fear it may be
		installed in the new college house on Hill Field.

		</p>

		<p>
			Students reporting no
		heat in their rooms face a more perilous bureaucratic problem: a tight budget.
		Employees said they were dissuaded from, and in some cases even instructed not
		to respond quickly to complaints of "no heat" so FRES management could stay
		within its allotted budget.

		</p>
		<p>
			"It's like the
		management does not care about the students," said Jim, a FRES employee with
		decades of experience in dealing with ventilation and air conditioners.

		</p>
		<p>
			Like most of the ten
		FRES maintenance workers interviewed, Jim declined to use his real name out of
		fear of being disciplined by his supervisors for speaking to a newspaper.

		</p>
		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>The battle between management and the FRES
		mechanics over declining infrastructure reached a fever point last November,
		when a series of hot water shortages in the high rises sent enraged employees
		complaining to their bosses.

		</p>
		<p>
			A Daily Pennsylvanian article from Nov.
		20 reported three hot water shortages in Rodin College House, including two
		instances where the whole building lost hot water.

		</p>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>The article quoted FRES Executive Director
		of Operations and Maintenance Ken Ogawa saying, "Ongoing maintenance and repairs such as
		these are usual in a building that is 40 years old and houses more than 750
		people."

		</p>
		<p>
			<blockquote> "How many times can we apologize? My heart goes out to these kids
		because their parents are paying so much to live here" -Jim
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>Behind the scenes, FRES employees said the
		article caused a stir among management as they urged employees to fix the
		problem quickly to avoid any continuing bad press.

		</p>
		<p>
			Jim and Lou, another
		FRES mechanic, both went to Ogawa and pointed to the overworked, cheap water
		ventilation system as the cause of continued malfunctions. The high rises have
		been renovated in recent years, but the water vents haven't been updated.

		</p>
		<p>
			"They did [the
		buildings] in stages so they put the same system in each of the high rises. And
		in all three buildings, the systems they put in are just horrible," Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Jim went to Paul Ostrander, an operations manager, before the
		Nov. 20 DP article to express his concerns with the deteriorating water vents
		in the high-rises.

		</p>
		<p>
			He urged Ostrander to
		lobby FRES higher-ups to replace the ventilation system and to ensure that it
		wasn't put into any new college houses.

		</p>
		<p>
			Ostrander reportedly rebuffed
		his concerns, saying that management had hired an engineering firm to look into
		the cause of the shortages.

		</p>
		<p>
			Ostrander deferred comment to
		a FRES spokeswoman, who declined to comment on his behalf.

		</p>
		<p>
			FRES has hired three
		different engineering firms to identify the root cause of the shortages, but
		they have yet to propose a solution.

		<p>
			"Each time we think
		we've fixed it, we haven't fixed it," Ogawa said in an interview.

		</p>
		<p>
			After seeing Ostrander,
		Jim approached Ogawa about the frequent shortages in an attempt to convince him
		to abandon the engineering firm consultations in favor of a system-wide
		overhaul.

		</p>
		<p>
			"[Ogawa's] response
		was, ‘The building has an old system, and it's a 45-year-old building.' The
		building itself [is old], but it's just been renovated. All mechanicals and all
		the systems are less than 10 years old," Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>
			The employees
		interviewed believe the use of engineering firms is a wasteful way to mask the
		systemic inefficiency undergirding the system itself. By opting for piecemeal
		reform instead of a system-wide overhaul, they think shortages will continue to
		cyclically occur.

		</p>

		<p>
			<img style="max-width:400px; float: right"src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/48779_graphic_day_2o.jpg">
		</p>

		<p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Other mechanics have also reached out to Ogawa directly in an
		attempt to convince him to replace the high-rise water vents. When Lou met with
		him, their meeting reportedly took on an aggressive tone.

		</p>
		<p>
			"[Ogawa] kept telling
		me, ‘My engineers say it's this.' I kept saying, ‘It's not that.' So two weeks
		later, [Ogawa] said, ‘The hot water's out,' and I said, ‘Go frig yourself, and
		call your engineer,'" Lou recalls. "[Ogawa] called me an asshole, basically,
		because I told him it's not that."

		</p>
		<p>
			Ogawa, who wouldn't
		comment specifically on Jim or Lou's remembrances, said that the problem is not
		related to the age of the building itself.

		</p>
		<p>
			"We don't believe it's
		a material condition issue but haven't figured out what the problem is," he
		said, adding that mechanics and contractors have both made a "number of
		repairs" in the buildings.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>
			There is hardly a consensus
		among University administrators on whether there even is a problem with the
		water system in the high rises and, if so, how to address it.

		</p>
		<p>
			Ogawa said that the
		problem may be related to the division of budgets within Penn Business
		Services, which hires FRES to perform repairs in residential buildings. There
		are separate budgets for "maintenance and renovation" and "capital projects."
		Penn spent $350 million in the last 12 years on capital projects for
		residential buildings, Executive Director of Business Services Doug Berger
		said, though it was unclear if this value included extra-budgetary investments.

		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the employees' argument that the shoddy hot water system is an
		infrastructure problem, repairs have been limited to the maintenance and
		renovation budget. If the problem could be designated as a capital projects
		issue, more resources could be used to address it.

		</p>
		<p>
			Berger said that, despite the division of budgets, all of the money for
		maintenance and capital projects comes from Penn Business Services.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Representatives from Penn Business Services also disputed the
		notion that there was a systemic problem affecting more than one building.

		</p>
		<p>
			"Our understanding is
		that we do have a problem in [Harrison College House] that has been difficult
		to diagnose," said Vice President for Penn Business Services Marie Witt. "It's
		not across the high rises."

		</p>
		<p>
			Penn Business Services
		has not received a request from Ogawa, or anyone else from FRES Operations
		and Maintenance, to devote more money to fixing the water system in any
		building.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I haven't had him come
		[ask for money] for Harrison," Berger said. "They're still evaluating
		what it may take [financially]."

		</p>
		<p>
			Anne Papageorge, the
		vice president for FRES, was not even aware that there was a concern over the
		hot water system in residential buildings.

		</p>
		<p>
			When asked if she had
		heard that some employees were concerned with the state of the water system,
		she replied, "I have not. This is actually a surprise to me."

		</p>
		<p>
			She expressed confusion
		over why the workers had not brought their worries to her before.

		</p>
		<p>
			"Why wouldn't they come
		to me? I don't get it honestly. I have tried to express that I have an open
		door," she said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Maintenance workers
		actually did repeatedly inform their supervisors of their concerns about the
		hot water system.

		</p>
		<p>
			In emails acquired by
		the DP, a former FRES area supervisor reached out to an engineering firm to
		purchase replacement parts for the hot water system in 2011.

		</p>
		<p>
			The supervisor emailed
		his boss, shift operations manager Mike Francis, for approval to purchase the
		parts, citing the need for the machines to have "redundancy," or duplicate
		parts to use in case of a leak.

		</p>
		<p>
			In an email from
		February 2013, Francis did not give permission to purchase replacement parts.
		According to Jim, the parts were eventually purchased this year and installed
		in Harrison and Harnwell, but not in Rodin.

		</p>
		<p>
			It was unclear why
		Papageorge was not aware of the conversation among her managers about
		possible repairs to the water system.

		<p>
			Despite the recent installation of "redundancies" in the water
		systems in certain buildings, maintenance workers still expressed little faith in the system's
		ongoing capacity.

		</p>
		<p>
			"The problem with the
		high rises and the hot water was shit-poor engineering," Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Other employees voiced
		similar criticisms.

		</p>
		<p>
			"They're not set up for
		continuous use. In an office building where you don't use them much, they're
		fine. But they don't work for a 20-story building with high demand. It's just
		proven. They don't work," said FRES mechanic Mike Patruno, currently on medical
		leave from work.

		</p>
		<p>
			The system is clearly
		complex, but no one seems to be able to &mdash; even after years of maintenance repairs
		&mdash; get a handle on possible solutions.

		</p>
		<p>
			"There's a lot of different
		components to that system," said Paul Forchielli, the assistant director for
		residential projects and quality assurance. "The heat exchangers in the
		basement feed the hot water, but that's not necessarily the only component to
		the system."

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			During the course of multiple interviews, FRES employees
		repeatedly expressed how frustrating it is to be the public face of a
		dysfunctional system.

		</p>
		<p>
			"We're the ones that
		have to keep going back in the same buildings with the same kids three or four
		times, and it's just like, how many times can we apologize? My heart goes out to
		these kids because their parents are paying so much to live here," Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Lou said that his tense
		encounters with Ogawa and other managers over the hot water shortages incited
		them to transfer his assignment from the high rises to other residential
		buildings.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I'm running out of
		buildings for them to move me to," he joked.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Another internal uproar
		arose over a series of radiator outages last winter.

		</p>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>Jim, who heads a team of six workers,
		responds to problems with airflow and radiators. Last winter, they had to
		respond to 150 complaints of no heat.

		</p>
		<p>
			Jim said his
		supervisors urged him to delay responding to work requests in order to keep
		FRES within their allotted maintenance budget.

		</p>
		<p>
			"They're looking at our
		budgets and wondering: How can we keep this down?" Jim said.
		"[They] won't give [us] any overtime. [They'll] just keep deferring maintenance and putting off
		issues for as long as [they] can."

		</p>

		<p>
			<blockquote>"The problem with the high rises and the hot water was
		shit-poor engineering," Jim said."
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			Jim's frustration
		boiled over in a conversation with Mike Francis.

		</p>
		<p>
			"'Would it be
		acceptable for you guys to wait six days for a service mechanic?'" Jim recalls
		asking. Francis deferred comment to a FRES spokeswoman, who did not return
		multiple emails.

		</p>
		<p>
			Francis reportedly said
		that budgetary concerns had to restrict the amount of effort Jim's team put
		into responding to heat shortages.

		</p>
		<p>
			Jim followed up on his
		concerns with Ostrander but was again rebuffed due to budgetary constrictions.
		He was enraged, he said, to hear in June that the budget had a $90,000 surplus.

		</p>
		<p>
			Ogawa denied that any
		maintenance requests are delayed or ignored because of budgetary concerns but
		admitted that budgetary projections in the winter may not align to the result
		at the end of the fiscal year in June. He confirmed that the past year did run
		a minimal surplus.

		</p>
		<p>
			"They stockpile it all
		year long. They scrimp and save by not providing the students the service that
		they paid for and cause unhealthy conditions, and then they use that money for
		something else," Jim said.

		</p>

		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Regardless of their time on the job or
		mechanical specialty, all employees interviewed reported similar roadblocks and
		obstructions in FRES' hierarchy of managers. A report to an area manager that
		goes unheeded often gets passed on to an upper-level supervisor, which
		eventually reaches Ogawa.

		</p>
		<p>
			Frustrated employees
		may jump the chain of command straight to Ogawa which, he admits, may
		contribute to growing tension between managers and workers.

			The employees said that speaking to the DP is their last
		option, given their concerns for student safety and repeated blockages in
		management.

		</p>
		<p>
			"This has been
		culminating for years. You're our last recourse because we've already gone to
		management," Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Other employees said
		they would have come to the press earlier if not for previous retaliation by
		management for speaking to reporters.

		</p>
		<p>
			"We're in jeopardy
		here. This is my family that's gonna lose out on this deal because I'm trying
		to protect students," Lou said. "[FRES doesn't] care, but I do. And the more we
