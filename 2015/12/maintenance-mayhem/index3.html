			<span class="dropcap">T</span>he "drip-drip-drip"
		sound of falling water was College sophomore Amanda Silberling's first hint
		that something was not right.

		</p>
		<p>
			Silberling, then a
		freshman in a double room in the Chesnut hall of Ware College House, looked
		over to see a stream of water falling on her roommate's bed.

		</p>
		<p>
			"It wasn't a thing and
		then one second later it was," she recalled. A pipe had frozen and burst behind
		the wall of her room, Silberling later learned.

		</p>
		<p>
			She told her
		residential advisor about the leak, and the RA sent out a maintenance request.
		Then they waited. And waited. After three hours, mechanics from Penn Facilities
		and Real Estate Services finally arrived in her room.

		</p>
		<p>
			"By the time
		maintenance came, half of our room was being flooded," Silberling said.

		</p>
		<p class="divider"><b> * * *</b></p>
		<p>
			<h2>‘Wait until tomorrow'</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Nearly any FRES mechanic or manager will agree that responding
		to active leaks trumps most other maintenance problems.

		</p>
		<p>
			However, the 10
		employees interviewed referred to numerous examples where management
		specifically told them to "wait until tomorrow" to respond or to, in some cases,
		blatantly ignore leaks.

		</p>
		<p>
			Jim, a FRES mechanic
		with decades of experience, said he was told to ignore a leak in Sansom
		East that occurred near the end of a workday.

		</p>
		<p>
			"[FRES] didn't want
		anybody to stay to fix this thing and make the repair. So they said, ‘Let it go
		until tomorrow,'" he recalled.

		</p>
		<p>
			FRES employees said the
		reason managers didn't want them to stay late was so they wouldn't have to be
		paid overtime.

		</p>
		<p>
			Delaying response time
		to leaks allows them to intensify, as in Silberling's case, or dampen walls and
		insulation, creating fertile areas for mold. Sometimes, students have to move
		their belongings to another room to allow FRES mechanics time to clean and
		contain the leak.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Two students living in the room above Silberling were
		displaced, and she was moved into a single room in Fisher. She was told she
		would only be there for about a week; she didn't return to her original room
		until a month later.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I was living in a hall
		with people I knew pretty well, then suddenly I didn't even know the people
		living around me," she recalled.

		</p>
		<p>
			Other students affected
		by leaks were moved to the Sheraton Hotel near campus. College sophomores
		Taylor Daniel and Rive Cadwallader, who lived in Fisher-Hassenfeld College
		House last year, were displaced by a sewage leak last October.

		</p>

		</p>
		<p>
			"Water just started
		seeping through our ceiling," Cadwallader recalled. "I didn't really know what
		to do because I was in a rush."

		</p>
		<p>
			Cadwallader and Daniel
		reported the initial leak the day it happened but never pressed the issue with
		FRES because the leak appeared to dry up. Only after water started gashing
		through their ceiling, and in other rooms on their floor, did FRES finally
		respond to their maintenance request.

		</p>
		<p>
			Around 10 people on
		their floor and the floor above them were displaced by the leak, they recalled.

		</p>

		<p>
			Administrators attribute the wait time to an overworked staff
		and backlog of requests, rather than any systemic aversion to paying overtime.

		</p>
		<p>
			FRES Executive Director
		of Operations and Maintenance Ken Ogawa said there is a "significant backlog"
		of maintenance requests.

		</p>
		<p>
			"It's an embarrassingly
		large amount," he added.

		</p>
		<p>
			Though Ogawa didn't
		cite a specific number, a FRES spokeswoman said in a phone conversation with a
		Daily Pennsylvanian editor that there was a three-month backlog.

		</p>
		<p>
			<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MOKP7vf3KyUgqyZQIk7lqSvzyt8tPC1ZQBWirPx6tjU/pubchart?oid=166079103&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		</p>
		<p>
			FRES has begun implementing
		a new program to speed up response time for work orders, and so far has seen a
		successful reduction.

		</p>
		<p>
			According to statistics
		provided by FRES, plumbing orders &mdash; encompassing leaks, some of the most
		troublesome maintenance problems &mdash; averaged response times of 19
		days in the 2011 fiscal year. This past fiscal year, the average response time
		was nine days.

		</p>
		<p class="divider"><b> * * *</b></p>
		<p>
			<h2> Deferring maintenance</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>Mechanics believe the number could be even
		lower if managers prioritized leaks over other requests and let employees work
		overtime to address complaints.

		</p>
		<p>
			FRES mechanics work a
		traditional 40-hour workweek based on an hourly wage. Jobs that require more
		intensive work, like leaks, may run past the end of the workday, requiring
		employees to work overtime. Managers avoid paying overtime, the employees said,
		instead urging them to defer maintenance issues.

		</p>
		<p>
			"They prefer not paying
		us overtime to stay over to finish these jobs and to correct problems," Jim
		said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Interviews with FRES
		administrators showed a divided, even contradictory point of view on the issue
		of overtime.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Ogawa said that the maintenance staff never defers maintenance
		issues because of a budgetary constraint.

		</p>
		<p>
			"We're not not doing
		work because we don't have money," he said. But his boss offered a different
		response when asked the same question.

		</p>
		<p>
			"We always have to
		manage our budget," Vice President for FRES Anne Papageorge said. "There are
		times where we say, ‘Yeah it doesn't need to be done on overtime. We'll do it
		on Monday.' "

		</p>
		<p>
			She added, "We have
		pressure to keep our expenses reasonable."

		</p>
		<p>
			The cost-cutting
		practice makes little sense to the mechanics, given that their overtime pay is
		the same as their hourly wage (not the traditional time-and-a-half) and
		deferring problems just creates more costs down the line if leaks worsen.

            });

          </script>
        </div>
		<p>
			Another decried
		management tactic is prioritizing maintenance complaints, however small or
		insignificant, based on whether the students' parents call FRES about the
		issue.

		</p>
		<p>
			"It has to go through
		the parent and then they'll really address it, and then they'll put priority on
		it," Lou, a FRES plumber said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Ogawa disputed this
		characterization.

		</p>
		<p>
			"Emergencies and a lot
		of imminent life safety issues are taken care of first," he said. "If a parent
		calls and says my door is squeaky, [and] it's a choice of doing that or taking
		the leak, clearly we do the leak first."

		</p>
		<p>
			However, managers may
		prioritize requests of an equivalent nature if a parent complains.

		</p>
		<p>
			"If everything is
		exactly the same, if a parent is screaming [about] your squeaky door and the
		parent of the kid down the hall isn't, we're likely to take your squeaky door
		first," Ogawa said.

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>

		<p class="divider"><b> * * *</b></p>
		<h2> Financial toll for Penn, <br> mental toll for students </h2>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			By deferring maintenance requests until they become
		unavoidable, FRES creates more expenses for itself by repairing walls, plaster
		and ceilings, funding hotel stays for displaced students and reimbursing
		students for damaged belongings.

		</p>

		<p>
			Penn paid for
		Cadwallader and Daniel to stay in the Sheraton Hotel for a week, compensated
		Cadwallader for the cost of some damaged bedding and gave the girls gift
		baskets and chocolate ("Lots of chocolate," Daniel recalls) after they moved
		back to Fisher.

		</p>
		<p>
			Silberling was also
		reimbursed for damaged items, and mechanics had to replace her entire wooden
		floor and parts of the ceiling and walls.

		</p>
		<p>
			<blockquote style="width:900px"> "There are times where we say, ‘Yeah it doesn't need to
		be done on overtime. We'll do it on Monday.'" -Vice President for FRES Anne
		Papageorge </blockquote>

		</p>
		<p>
			FRES' "wait until
		tomorrow" mantra doesn't seem to have saved them money and has only angered
		displaced students.

		</p>
		<p>
			"It's completely
		illogical that one of their arguments for not helping immediately is to save
		money," Silberling said. "None of that would have happened if they would have
		come into the room when we called."

		</p>
		<p>
			Beyond more expenses
		for Penn, they also inconvenience students by having them undergo a
		time-consuming, bothersome and stressful moving process.

		</p>
		<p>
			Silberling ended up dropping out of her writing seminar
		shortly after being displaced. Her professors were very accommodating and
		helpful, she said, but the stress of the early weeks of the spring semester,
		combined with her unstable housing situation, left her hardly at peace.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I feel like the flood
		was a breaking point," she said.
