			<span class="dropcap">E</span>ach year, the staff
		members of Penn Facilities and Real Estate Services attend a mandatory meeting
		(a "forced audience," as one employee calls it) in Houston Hall with Anne
		Papageorge, the vice president for FRES.

		</p>
		<p>
			"It's a dog-and-pony
		show, because they get up there and tell us how good everyone's doing," said
		Jim, a FRES mechanic with decades of experiences in handling air ventilation
		units and air conditioners.

		</p>
		<p>
			For the ten FRES
		workers interviewed by The Daily Pennsylvanian, the meeting with Papageorge epitomizes
		their perception of management: purveyors of cheap platitudes that skimp on
		essential equipment and infrastructure to help Penn's bottom line.

		</p>
		<p>
			Promotions based on
		favoritism and kickbacks produce managers without substantive knowledge of
		mechanics, employees said. As many of them reiterated: Papageorge's background
		is in landscaping, not maintenance.

		</p>
		<p>
			Employees skip the
		chain of command to speak to upper-management directly in defiance of their
		immediate supervisors, whom they decry as too young, inexperienced and
		uneducated on mechanical matters. Deferring maintenance problems or outsourcing
		them to contractors enrages mechanics, who said they preferred working overtime
		to contain a problem before it worsened.

		</p>
		<p>
			The resentment produces
		distrust, cynicism and miscommunication.

		</p>
		<p>
			"No matter what we tell
		them, they think we're lying," said Mike Patruno, a FRES
		mechanic currently on leave for medical reasons, who like Jim,
		has decades of experience at Penn.

		</p>
		<p>
			The institutional
		dysfunction contributes to weakened employee morale and longer response times
		for student maintenance requests as employees and managers wrangle over
		appropriate response measures.

		</p>
		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Jim leads a six-man
		team in responding to maintenance problems with air conditioners or air
		handlers, the central ventilation unit that distributes air throughout a
		building. His team is on-call for any air filtration problems in Penn
		residential buildings. In recent years, he said, their working conditions amid
		deteriorating infrastructure have become increasingly unsafe and inefficient.

		</p>
		<p>
			"If you open some of
		these air handlers up &mdash; we've been downsized and downgraded so much," he said.
		"We have one filter guy who changes the filters and air handlers, and some of
		these air handlers are in precarious locations like mechanical rooms, away
		where if something happened to that guy, nobody would find him for a week until
		he started to smell."

		</p>

        </p>

		<p>
			Wherever employee
		resentment ends &mdash; whether it be at anger over a frustrating bureaucracy or
		increasing reliance on contractors &mdash; it begins with the workers' immediate
		concern: unsafe working conditions.

		</p>
		<p>
			Some residence halls
		have infrastructure so shoddy, Jim is surprised air manages to even filter out
		into the building.

		</p>
		<p>
			"In Stouffer, those
		units up top are so old and obsolete. They're disgusting. When you open them
		up, it's covered in mold," Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>
			His team can barely
		even vacuum or clean out the units, because they're so old and worn out.

		</p>
		<p>
			"You can't spray it
		down and soak it. So we've been telling the area managers for years, this
		building is the worst. We need to get something done. And it's like the area
		managers don't even care," he said.

		</p>
		<p>
			When asked specifically
		about the conditions of air handlers in Stouffer, FRES Executive Director of
		Operations & Maintenance Ken Ogawa deferred comment to Penn Residential
		Services. When contacted by the DP, a residential services administrator
		deferred comment to a separate spokeswoman for Penn Business Services, who
		directed requests for comment back to FRES, writing in an email, "Maintenance
		of the College Houses is done by FRES."

		</p>

	<div class="col-md-9 col-md-push-2" <div class="container">
		<p>
			In a later meeting, Papageorge deferred comment on the same
		question about mechanical room conditions in Stouffer to representatives from
		Penn Business Services, who then agreed to an interview.

		</p>
		<p>
			In that interview,
		Executive Director of Penn Business Services Doug Berger said, "That's the
		purview of [FRES] maintenance [staff]."

		</p>
		<p>
			Ogawa followed up in an
		email later, writing "We have routinely inspected, cleaned and addressed safety
		deficiencies in coordination with EHRS (Environmental Health & Radiation
		Safety) and the building administrators."

		</p>
		<p>
			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Among the FRES workers interviewed, none expressed confidence
		in the competence of their area managers, the immediate supervisors that
		oversee groups of college houses.

		</p>
		<p>
			One area supervisor was
		criticized by employees as inexperienced and unknowledgeable about actual
		maintenance work.

		</p>
		<p>
			"He knows nothing about
		mechanical. He couldn't tell you if that is a lock [or not]," said Patruno.

		</p>
		<p>
			This manager is in his
		mid-to-late 20s and was promoted over other mechanics with decades of
		experience, prompting strong resentment among FRES veterans.

		</p>
		<p>
			The supervisor in
		question declined a request for comment through a FRES spokeswoman.

		</p>
		<p>
			Ken Ogawa, the
		executive director of operations at FRES, agreed that many employees are
		disgruntled about changes in management.

		</p>
		<p>
			"There's been a fair
		amount of turmoil within the leadership teams for a couple of years," he said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Many managers,
		including the aforementioned area supervisor, are new and lack the respect of
		long-tenured staff.

		</p>
		<p>
			"People don't like
		change," Ogawa said.

			Papageorge said that
		there will always be some dissenting voices within a large and complex
		organization, but she and her leadership team are working hard to build bridges
		between management and workers.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I expect that every
		staff member will speak up when they feel strongly about something," she said.
		"I can't read people's minds."

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>

			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>

		<p>
			One area of special contention for FRES workers and their
		bosses involves the purchase of equipment in the summer. Managers continually
		obstruct or flat out reject the purchase of many crucial utility tools,
		employees said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Jim said Mike Francis,
		a shift operations manager, ordered workers to buy materials "as they need it"
		instead of letting them purchase in bulk at the beginning of the summer.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I don't know [Mike's]
		rationale &mdash; stupidity, laziness?" Jim said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Francis declined a
		request for comment through a FRES spokeswoman.

		</p>
		<p>
			According to Mike
		Patruno, Francis had a $5,000 budget that
		workers were not allowed to go over in the summer.

		</p>
		<p>
			As detailed in a
		previous article, emails acquired by the DP do confirm Francis rejecting at
		least one important purchase by FRES workers in 2013: a cache of replacement
		parts for the hot water system in the high rises, though workers said he
		sanctioned the purchase months later.

		</p>
		<p>
			<blockquote> "I expect that every staff member will speak up when
		they feel strongly about something," she said. "I can't read people's minds."
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			"We have 3 to 4 guys
		that go through 700 fan coil units, changing filters, making repairs and
		cleaning, vacuuming and sanitizing units," Jim said. "There's no time for
		maintenance in a 40-hour work week."

		</p>
		<p>
			Without the parts the
		employees claim they need, their workload gets far too fast to handle
		themselves, requiring an extra expense for Penn: the hiring of independent
		contractors.

		</p>
		<p>
			"The goal is to
		contract out as much as they can," Jim said. "In essence, they're sabotaging
		us."

		</p>
		<p>

		</p>

			<p style="text-align:center"><b> * * *</b></p>

		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout multiple interviews, FRES administrators
		acknowledged the discontent among mechanics.

		</p>
		<p>
			"I can't guarantee that
		all of the work I do on a leadership level filters down to them," Papageorge
		said.

		</p>
		<p>
			She admitted that there
		are "people in our organization who perpetuate a labor-management culture," but
		said that one of her priorities as vice president was to ensure supervisors had
		the personal touch that comes with leadership, by way of conferences, training
		sessions and annual evaluations.

		<p>
			"We have tried to advance the skill level across the
		management side for the entire organization," she said.

		</p>
		<p>
			Many employees remain deeply
		unsatisfied at the state of intrapersonal relations among FRES staff, the
		status of shoddy infrastructure within residential buildings, and the sense, in
		the end, that Penn and its administrative units just do not care about
		students.

		</p>
		<p>
		</p>
		<p>
			"I'd like to be
		nonprofit like Penn. The things that they do and get away with are
		unbelievable," said Mike Patruno, the only mechanic in this series who felt
		comfortable using his real name. "[FRES] makes organized crime look like choir
		boys."
