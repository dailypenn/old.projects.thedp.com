            <p>The Democratic National Committee announced that Philadelphia will host the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, 2016. Philly beat out the two other finalists, Columbus, Ohio and Brooklyn, N.Y., to host the weeklong convention that
              will formally nominate the Democratic nominee for president.</p>

            <p>Penn’s administration released the Report of the Task Force on Psychological Health and Welfare, an attempt to address mental wellness among students after six suicides within fifteen months. The report made a number of recommendations aimed
              to create cultural change among students, including the creation of an online mental wellness module for incoming freshmen, the clarification of leave of absence policies, the development of a centralized website with mental wellness resources,
              the implementation of an emergency phone line, the launch of the I CARE training program and a reduction in wait times for appointments at Counseling and Psychological Services. Following the report’s release, students criticized the administration’s
              response, pointing out that the report lacked firm deadlines and did not specify how or why Penn’s culture was different from that of other schools. The administration ultimately followed through on most of the recommendations, though a
              centralized mental wellness website is still in the works.</p>

            <p>Just prior to basketball’s final weekend of the season, coach Jerome Allen’s departure from the program was announced on March 7, ending the former Penn star’s near-six-year tenure at the helm of his alma mater. On March 16, former Red and
              Blue assistant Steve Donahue was tapped to replace the departed Allen. Donahue comes to Penn following head coaching stints at Boston College and Cornell, where he took the Big Red to the Sweet 16 in the 2010 NCAA Tournament.</p>

            <p>Student group Fossil Free Penn sponsored the University’s first ever undergraduate referendum last Spring. A third of Penn undergraduates cast votes — more than those who voted on campus during the midterm election — and 87.8 percent supported
              divesting from fossil fuels. Last week the University Council, a board made up of student representatives and administrators, considered the proposal and decided it merited further consideration. Two more committees must approve the proposal
              before it reaches the executive committee of the Board of Trustees, which has the ultimate power to divest.</p>

            <p>Penn’s chapter of Alpha Chi Omega moved off campus and re-branded itself as “OAX” after more than 85 percent of the sorority’s members voted not to sign a formal agreement with the University, whose sanctions included abstaining from social
              events for two years and electing a new board. Prior to the vote, Penn’s Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life placed the sorority on probation after it violated Penn’s Alcohol and Drug Policy. Similarly, Pi Kappa Phi moved off campus and
              re-branded as “Phi” after disaffiliating with OFSL and its national chapter over the summer. The fraternity broke with Penn after a disciplinary battle that began when it was suspended after a hazing allegation last fall.</p>

          <p>Protests became a hallmark feature of Penn’s campus this year. In mid-April, students gathered on Locust Walk to protest the closing of the Africa Center. Also in April, the group Students Organizing for Unity and Liberation organized a mock
            slave auction outside the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in response to a holiday card the fraternity had published including a black blow up sex doll. In November, students marched through campus to stand in solidarity with protests occurring
            at Yale University and the University of Missouri fighting for increased racial sensitivity on college campuses. Students on Penn’s campus joined the protests with a sit-in on Market street and delivered demands for the administration outside
            Amy Gutmann’s house. </p>

            to sail ahead of the competition and secure first place, becoming the first Ivy League athlete in 66 years to capture the discus title. </p>

            </p>
            <p>The American Association of Universities released the results of the Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault. The survey, the largest on college campus sexual violence to date, was administered in April. It revealed that
              by senior year, nearly a third of Penn women have experienced nonconsensual touching or penetration. The results also indicated that Penn students are disappointingly unaware of Penn’s resources and were less likely than their peers at other
              schools to bring issues forward. Students at Penn were also less likely than average to believe that a victim of sexual violence would be supported by fellow students in making a report, that campus officials would take the report seriously
              or that the safety of the victim would be protected. In an email to Penn students, President Amy Gutmann and Provost Vincent Price called the findings “deeply troubling.”</p>

              1.2 billion Catholics spoke at various sites and spoke about religious toleration and the importance of family bonds. He attracted crowds in the hundreds of thousands, virtually shutting down the city's main thoroughfares for the weekend.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In October, the Penn campus was put on high alert when the Division of Public Safety warned of a violent threat made to an unspecified university near Philadelphia. The anonymous threat, which was originally posted on the social media website
              4chan, warned that a “fellow robot would take up arms against a university near Philadelphia.” The post was made less than a week after a shooter killed 10 people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Penn did not officially cancel classes,
              but some professors chose to do so due to low attendance. No violence in connection to the threat was ever reported. In reaction to the threat, some students formed the new campus group, Penn Against Gun Violence, whose Facebook page has
              garnered almost 250 likes since it began in November.</p>

            <p>Following a 2-8 season in 2014, Penn football came into 2015 with dim prospects for first-year head coach Ray Priore. After beating Villanova for the first time since 1911, the Quakers went on to win their last six Ivy League games to take
              a share of the Ancient Eight crown. Leading the effort for the Red and Blue were Ray Priore — the first rookie coach to win an Ivy title since 1986 and winner of the Ivy League Coach of the Year award — and senior Tyler Drake. The linebacker
              was named Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, having led the league in sacks, tackles for loss and forced fumbles.</p>
