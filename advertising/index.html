                        We are The Daily Pennsylvanian, the newspaper by and for the students of the University of Pennsylvania. When our readers open “the DP” every morning, they open a world of campus and city news, feature stories, sports, commentary, advertising, and much more. Whether in our daily newspaper, our weekly magazine, our special issues, or our websites, The Daily Pennsylvanian is the first read for the Penn community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an era when we often hear about the struggles of mass-market commercial newspapers and about students only getting their information online, The Daily Pennsylvanian thrives as a community newspaper because we remain relevant to our audience of devoted readers. And for our advertisers, that’s why we are a proven and eff ective way — and still the best way — to reach Penn. We off er multiple media in print, online and out-of-home that reach diff erent segments of the Penn market, from students to faculty and staff to parents and alumni, allowing you to choose the medium or media mix that best suits your advertising needs.
                    </p>

                <h1>Ad Submission Guidelines</h1>
                <h3>Electronic Format</h3>
                <h5>Print Ads</h5>
                <p>
                    Ads saved as PDF files are <b>preferred</b>, since a PDF file embeds all graphics and fonts into a single, complete file. We can also accept files saved in TIFF or EPS format. Web file formats, such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG will generally <b>not</b> reproduce well in print and should not be submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can also accept native files from InDesign, QuarkXPress, Illustrator or Photoshop. For best compatibility, Mac files are preferred. We cannot publish, but can re-create, ads from PowerPoint or Microsoft Word. We <b>cannot</b> accept files from Microsoft Publisher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ad Sizes:</b> Ads submitted electronically which are not built to the correct column widths will be re-sized.

                <p>
                    <b>Resolution:</b> Photos for ads submitted electronically should be scanned at 170 dpi or higher. Ads are output and printed at 100 lpi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Fonts:</b> If you submit a file in PDF format, you must make sure all fonts are embedded when the PDF file is created. If you submit a file in any other format, you must supply all fonts used in your ad. Only Mac fonts are acceptable; Windows fonts will not work. The Daily Pennsylvanian reserves the right to substitute similar fonts if a font is corrupted or not supplied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Color</b>: All color advertisements are printed using the four process CMYK colors. Please convert any color text or graphics from RGB to CMYK color.
                </p>
                <h5>Internet Ads</h5>
                <p>
                    You can design an ad (GIF or JPEG format preferred) and send us the file to host on our ad server. Animation is acceptable, but audio is not. You must also provide the URL of the page to which you want your ad linked. For Internet banner ads, you can also send us the HTML code for an ad to run on your ad server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ad Sizes:</b> Ads submitted electronically which are not built to the correct banner size will be re-sized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Resolution</b> Ads should be saved at a resolution of 96 dpi or pixels/inch. (72 dpi is also acceptable.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Color:</b> All files should be saved in RGB color format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>File Size:</b> Maximum file size is 500k.
                </p>

                <h3>Placement &amp; Delivery</h3>
                <p>
                    Ads submitted electronically are preferred. Ads may be emailed or supplied on USB Flash Drives or CDs. When using email and submitting multiple files (such as fonts), it is advisable to compress all files into a single Zip file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, The Daily Pennsylvanian can download an ad from your website or FTP site. The Daily Pennsylvanian can also create an ad for you. Basic design is included in the cost of the ad. A large number of photographs or extensive typing is subject to additional production charges. Any artwork submitted by the advertiser will not be returned unless the advertiser requests it. There are several ways to place an ad:

                    <h3>Ad Submission</h3>
                    <p>
                        All advertising is subject to acceptance by The Daily Pennsylvanian, which reserves the right to reject any advertisement at its sole discretion at any time prior to publication. The Daily Pennsylvanian will not knowingly publish advertisements which unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, ancestry, or physical handicap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Daily Pennsylvanian will make all reasonable effort to see that advertising is published, displayed or distributed as ordered and accepted. However, The Daily Pennsylvanian will not be responsible for any consequential damages resulting from failure to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advertisers and agencies forwarding insertion orders which contain incorrect rates or conditions are advised that the advertising called for will be inserted and charged in accordance with the rates and regulations stated in this Rate Book and The Daily Pennsylvanian Basic Advertising Contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The advertiser and/or agency agrees to assume full and complete responsibility and liability for the content (including text representations, illustrations, and copyrights) of any advertisements placed in The Daily Pennsylvanian and/or its related print and online publications and/or its other advertising products and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advertising cancelled after the deadline for publication will be removed from the issue, but the advertiser remains liable for payment of the full cost of the ad.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Annual Contracts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Annual Contract advertising agreements commit an advertiser to run a specified dollar amount of advertising during a 12-month period in return for discounted advertising rates. Advertisers who do not fulfill their Annual Contract agree to pay, at termination, a short rate (adjustment) for all advertising discounted under the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advertisers may upgrade to a larger contract, at a lower rate, at any time during the contract. The new rate will be effective for all advertising run after the date of the upgrade, but the new rate is not retroactive to advertising previously run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Annual Contract rates in this Rate Book are not guaranteed beyond August 15, 2016. An advertiser whose Annual Contract expires after August 15, 2016 will pay the published 2016-17 rate for the same contract level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Annual Contracts and contract upgrades must be approved by The Daily Pennsylvanian’s Director of Sales & Marketing before becoming effective.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Errors &amp; Adjustments</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Daily Pennsylvanian will be responsible for errors in advertisements only in proportion to the bearing that the error has in relation to the entire ad, as determined by the Finance Manager of The Daily Pennsylvanian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Daily Pennsylvanian will not consider adjustment of payment for any advertisement involving typographical errors or erroneous insertion unless notice is given to the Finance Manager within ten (10) days of the first monthly statement. The Daily Pennsylvanian will not be liable for more than one incorrect insertion of any advertisement.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Paper Sizes:</b> The Daily Pennsylvanian prints its publications in two sizes. A full-size broadsheet newspaper is 12” wide by 21” tall with a maximum printed area per page of 10.875” wide by 20” tall. A tabloid pull-out is 10.5” wide by 12” tall with a maximum printed area per page of 9.046” wide by 10.5” tall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ad Sizes:</b> Sizes are expressed as the number of columns wide by the number of inches tall (i.e. a “2 x 4” ad is 2 columns wide by 4 inches tall). Multiplying columns by inches gives the total number of column inches (i.e. 2 x 4 = 8 column inches). Multiplying column inches by the ad rate gives the ad cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any ad size can be created according to these rules:

                        <li>Widths are in full columns (no half-columns or fractions)</li>

                        <li>Minimum size: 2 col. inches (1 col. x 2” or 2 col. x 1”)</li>
                        <li>Broadsheet ads taller than 17” will be charged and run as a full page ad (20” tall). Tabloid ads taller than 8.5” will be charged and run as a full page ad (10.5” tall).</li>

                    Should ad copy not be received by deadline, the ad will be subject to cancellation from the edition. Advertising cancelled after deadline is subject to full charge.

                    Advertisers requiring proofs, please add one business day to the deadlines.
