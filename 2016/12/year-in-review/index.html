            Engineering graduate student Stephen Kyle Wilshusen died over winter break. His death was ruled a suicide. Wilshusen was a first-year Ph.D. student in computer science. He worked in the general robotics, automation, sensing and perception lab, a specialized lab within the Engineering School that does research in robotics. Dean Vijay Kumar announced his death in an email to the Engineering community on Jan. 11.

            With powerhouse Princeton coming off an historic 30-0 regular season in 2015, the Ivy League women’s basketball world was wondering who would be able to take down the juggernaut Tigers. With star veterans Sydney Stipanovich, Michelle Nwokedi and Anna Ross joined by the presence of incoming transfer Kasey Chambers, Mike McLaughlin’s Penn squad was up to the task. Two instant classic Penn-Princeton games were decided by a combined four points, and the Quakers came out on top of both, with four players scoring in double figures in an emotional 62-60 win at Princeton to clinch the school’s fourth-ever league championship.

            In what would be his last in-season race with the Quakers, then-senior Chris Swanson won the NCAA championship in the 1650-yard freestyle. Swanson had finished 11th in the nation in 2015, just short of being an All-American, but shattered that mark in 2016 by finishing first. In a fairytale comeback, Swanson made up a three second deficit in the final 50 yards to steal a win, finishing just .12 seconds ahead of South Carolina’s Akaram Mahmoud. Swanson would go on to swim at US Olympic trials later that year.

            CIA Director John Brennan’s moderated speech at the Penn Museum was shut down early by protesters who repeatedly interrupted to speak out against the United States government’s use of drones. A mixture of people who were and were not affiliated with Penn held up signs that read: “Drone strikes breed terrorism.” They shouted phrases like “drones kill kids,” and “black lives matter.” Many were escorted out of the building and the event sparked debates about free speech on college campuses in its aftermath. Following the event, the administration sent out an email to Penn undergraduate students urging them to remember the importance of free speech.

            Wharton junior Olivia Kong died in the early morning at the 40th Street station stop on SEPTA's Market-Frankford Line. Her death was ruled a suicide. Students held a candlelight vigil on College Green that evening to remember her life. In response to Kong's death, criticism arose directed at both the University's culture surrounding mental health and the administration's handling of the announcement. The initial email from the President's office reported the incident but did not provide Kong's name, and an email from Wharton initially described her death as an "accident." Students circulated a petition to the administration that included a list of proposed mental health reforms. On April 20, the administration sent an email announcing the extension of CAPS hours and a guide to supporting peers.

            Chance the Rapper performed at Franklin Field for Penn’s 2016 Spring Fling concert — after he almost called off the show due to illness. The Social Planning and Events Committee Concerts directors received a call from Chance’s management during opener DJ 3LAU’s set, detailing his reasons for cancellation. Chance eventually appeared onstage over an hour after the end of DJ 3LAU’s performance. The Chicago-born rapper had previously performed at the SPEC-TRUM fall concert in 2013. Since his performance at Spring Fling, Chance has released the mixtape “Coloring Book” and received seven Grammy Award nominations.

            The summer was a big one for beverages. On the same day, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed a bill into law to make it easier to buy and sell beer, wine and liquor in Pennsylvania, and a City Council committee in Philadelphia approved a new tax on sugary drinks and diet sodas. Manifestations of the alcohol law have since sprung up at Penn, with wine now available for sale in the Fresh Grocer and longer hours for the liquor store on 43rd and Chestnut. The soda tax doesn’t go into effect until Jan. 1. Experts are still unsure about how dramatically it will affect the cost of soda, but those changes could happen abruptly.

            Philadelphia hosted the Democratic National Convention over the summer, and thousands descended on the Wells Fargo Center in late July to officially nominate Democratic candidates for president and vice-president in the 2016 presidential election. Hillary Clinton was chosen as the party’s nominee for president by a 59.67% majority of delegates, becoming the first female presidential candidate to be nominated by a major national party in the United States. Penn students volunteered at the convention and welcomed delegates through the Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee, chaired by former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell. The DNC was not without its controversies. In the weeks leading up to the convention, emails from the Democratic National Committee were leaked, and allegedly showed bias against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The chair of the committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned her position, and many Sanders supporters staged protests during the convention.

            Hundreds of flyers featuring an email allegedly sent by the off-campus organization OZ were posted across campus. The email, which was reportedly sent to freshman girls, included the subject line “Wild Wednesday” and a poem addressed to “ladies,” which read in part, “May we have your attention please/We’re looking for the fun ones/And say f**k off to a tease.” The flyers were stamped with the words "THIS IS WHAT RAPE CULTURE LOOKS LIKE" and "WE ARE WATCHING". The protests sparked a media firestorm, with coverage from BuzzFeed, Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Business Insider. The email also provoked condemnations from the Interfraternity Council, the University administration, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). Nine hundred women from 17 affiliated sororities, off-campus organizations, co-ed fraternities and multicultural groups signed an open letter denouncing the "overarching culture" of misogyny in fraternities and other all-male organizations. Penn announced a task force in November to address the “negative influence of unaffiliated and unsupervised groups."

            Second-year medical student Ari Frosh died early in the semester at his home in Massachusetts. His death was ruled a suicide. Frosh was 26 years old and on a leave of absence at the time. He received his undergraduate degree from Colorado College in 2012, and worked at Bryn Mawr College and the National Cancer Institute before he enrolled at Penn. An email from Vice Provost for University Life Valarie Swain-Cade McCoullum read, “In sadness and with affectionate reflection, we write today to share that Ari Frosh, a second-year Medical student, died suddenly last week.” The email was co-signed by Senior Vice Dean for Education at the Perelman School of Medicine and was sent on behalf of Penn President Amy Gutmann and Provost Vincent Price.

            Campaign surrogates for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton flocked to Philadelphia in droves this fall. President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren all made appearances at different points. Just weeks before the election, Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine (D-Va.) held a rally at Penn Park and addressed a packed crowd of students on a chilly night in October. In her remarks, the former senator and secretary of state mentioned The Daily Pennsylvanian’s endorsement of her candidacy and implored, “Friends don’t let friends vote for Trump."

            Over the hump and then some. Penn sprint football has been a successful program for a number of years now, but with one ever-present caveat — that against Army and Navy, the Quakers wouldn’t stand a chance. That caveat is no more. This season, in some of the most exciting Penn athletics games this semester in ANY sport, the Red and Blue knocked off both Army and Navy to claim a historic CSFL championship and their second-ever undefeated season. Senior captain Mike McCurdy unanimously earned the CSFL Player of the Year award, shattering numerous team records along the way. To say this season was a success would be a stark understatement.

            Penn cross country had one of its most successful seasons in recent memory on both the men's and women's sides. Led by a strong class of seniors, the men captured their first Ivy Heptagonal Championship in 43 years, and five runners earned All-Ivy honors. Senior Nick Tuck also qualified for the NCAA Championship after a sixth-place finish in Regionals. On the women's side, the team made its first ever NCAA Championship appearance, placing 24th overall. Senior Ashley Montgomery led the way for the Red and Blue, finishing 13th — good enough to make her a USTFCCCA All-American and tie the program record for best individual performance at NCAAs.

            Engineering graduate student Alfredo “Freddy” Abravanel died, and his death was later ruled a suicide. Abravanel had sub-matriculated into Penn's master’s program in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics after graduating with his bachelor’s degree in 2016. The University sent an email to the entire School of Engineering and Applied Science, notifying them that he died "unexpectedly." President Amy Gutmann and Provost Vincent Price also announced a support session that was held later that day in the Towne Building.

            A Penn alumnus was finally elected president. In an incredible upset, 1968 Wharton graduate Donald Trump flipped several key swing states by narrow margins to defeat Hillary Clinton. Trump capitalized heavily on the popular anti-establishment messaging that also fueled the candidacy of Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) earlier in the year. Several of Trump’s core policy positions — specifically those relating to religious freedom, immigration and climate policy — have drawn criticism at Penn, and the mood on campus was somber after Trump's election. Three of his children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Trump, also graduated from Penn. William Henry Harrison, the ninth president, briefly attended Penn's Medical School but did not graduate.

          <h2>Racist GroupMe shocks campus</h2>

            Several black freshmen were added against their will to a GroupMe titled "Mud Men” and “Trump is love” at different points, in which they were sent racist messages, an image of a lynching and an event called “Daily lynching.” Penn officials announced that the three individuals linked to the GroupMe were all Oklahoma residents and that no Penn students were involved in sending the racist content. After FBI and police investigations, a student at Tulsa Community College was placed on “interim academic suspension,” and a student at the University of Oklahoma was suspended. The OU student is now no longer enrolled. The incident was condemned by more than 460 Penn faculty members who signed an open letter urging President-elect Donald Trump to denounce the messages. Over 3,000 alumni also signed a five-page letter of support that appeared in the Nov. 15 issue of The Daily Pennsylvanian. Condemnations of the event also came from civil rights activist Deray McKesson, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), among others.

            Maybe it wasn't as unexpected as the title run of Ray Priore's first season, but that doesn't mean Penn football's second Ivy League championship in as many years was any less sweet. In eerily similar fashion to last year's squad, a pair of non-conference losses dampened optimism around the program early on, but it was all business once league play hit, with the Red and Blue winning their first four conference games by a combined 80 points. After Penn took a 28-0 drubbing at the hands of Princeton, it was "win or go home" from there on out, and the Quakers did just that, with Alek Torgersen and Justin Watson leading a two-minute drill for the ages to upset first-place Harvard before the squad officially locked up the title with a win at Cornell a week later.
