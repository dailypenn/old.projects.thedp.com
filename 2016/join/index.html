              34th Street Magazine is Penn's arts, culture and social authority. We cover the best and worst of Penn life with opinion, wit and flair.

              Street is either the coolest collection of weirdos or the weirdest collection of cool-os at this school. We’re thankful to have so many excited and passionate people working for us this semester. We hope that you will be one of them. We're looking for
              writers, photographers, designers, artists, web designers and videographers. We want people to take pictures of #foodporn #streeeats, review existential art (is that art?) and scoop the latest downtown drama.
            </p>

              Our first writer's meeting is September 1st at 6:30pm. Questions, comments or concerns? <a href="mailto://johns@34st.com">Contact Emily Johns.</a>
