          <h2>Sophomore squad ready to go into year two</h2>
          <h5>Jonathan Pollack</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
	Famous groups often come in threes. The Three Stooges. The Three Musketeers. The Big Three.
</p>
<p>
	And now there’s the Three Sophomores.
</p>
<p>
	The triumvirate of Jackson Donahue, Jake Silpe and Max Rothschild was not expected to be a featured part of Penn basketball's rotationlast year. But with the departure of guards Antonio Woods and Tony Hicks early on in the season and a midseason injury that sidelined then senior Darien Nelson-Henry for a few games, the trio was thrust into the spotlight just a few games into their college careers.
</p>
<p>
	To say that they exceed expectations would be an understatement. The now sophomores were three of the team’s top five scorers in conference play. Donahue led the team in three-point percentage, Silpe led the team in steals and assists, and all three of them logged significant minutes, especially in conference play.
</p>
<p>
	But now, instead of being the undercard, the spotlight is on them, as they figure to each play key roles on this year’s team.
</p>
<p>
	“I think all three are an integral part of what we’re doing,” Penn coach Steve Donahue said. “That being said, they’re all going to be challenged this year, and every year, as we continue to build this program.”
</p>
<p>
	That challenge this year manifests itself in increased responsibility on the team for each of the three players. Instead of being complementary pieces, Silpe and Jackson Donahue will form the basis of Penn’s backcourt, and Rothschild will factor in as a big player down low. Likewise, that increased role in the team means that opponents will focus their game plans more on dealing with the threats that they each pose.
</p>
<p>
	The graduation of Nelson-Henry also figures to factor in to the trio’s heightened roles on the team, especially for Rothschild, the 6-foot-8 forward from Chicago.
</p>
<p>
	"[Nelson-Henry] was obviously a big low post threat, and I think that’s what I have to offer,” Rothschild said. “I try to bang in the low post, be physical, and on defense, I am little bit quicker than he was, because he was a bit heavier than I am. I’ll just be trying to score more in the low post.”
</p>
<p>
	All of that culminates into a different approach for the trio as they head into their sophomore season.
</p>
<p>
	“I think [my role] does change a little bit,” Jackson Donahue said. “Going into that role last year, it was more of like, and I got it from a couple of the coaches after games joking, saying like, ‘You weren’t even in the scouting report’, so it was kind of like I was a really under the radar kind of player.
</p>
<p>
	"So I think it is a little bit different, I think I will be kind of keyed on in a lot of teams’ defenses, so it’s on me to really work to get open, and to make sure that other guys are doing the right thing to get our offense going.”
</p>
<p>
	The three of them step into this highlighted role very well prepared though. After playing together and with the program for a year, they have the experience necessary to take on this year’s challenges.
</p>
<p>
	“I got a lot of experience [last year],” Silpe said. “I thought it could have turned out a little better had I played a little bit better in the middle of the season and beginning of the season, but I felt like I finished pretty strong. But this year, I have a year under me, I’m ready, I know it’s coming, and I’m excited to start.”
</p>
<p>
	Jackson Donahue agreed.
</p>
<p>
	“I think with a year under our belt, and having such a good year under our belt, that going into this year it’s going to be a lot easier for us to be more cohesive with the team and really limiting the stupid silly mistakes,” he said.
</p>
<p>
	Even with all of their success last year, the sophomores still have room for improvement. But with such a high starting point, the Quakers have much to be enthusiastic about.
</p>
<p>
	“All three have to just keep getting better so we get better as a program,” Steve Donahue said. “But I’m excited about where they’re at at this stage in their careers and I think they can really help us build into a champion.”
</p>
<p>
	So when Penn takes the floor for the first time this season on Nov. 9, a huge chunk of the focus will be on the three sophomores. But they’re ready for it.
