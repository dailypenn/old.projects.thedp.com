        	Ready or not, here it comes.
        </p>
        <p>
        	After months of buildup and debate, all questions will finally be put to rest when the Ivy League will engage in its first-ever conference basketball tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“It gives us the chance to be in a playoff atmosphere and let our players experience something different, so it’s really exciting,” women’s basketball coach Mike McLaughlin said. “If you make it to that Final Four, anyone can win it.”
        </p>

          </div>

        <p>
        	One unquestionable benefit of the tournament will be the rise in the conference’s national exposure, as no one can question the imminent boost in media and fan scrutiny. The men’s and women’s tournaments will take place on March 11 and 12 at the Palestra &mdash; with March 12 also being “Selection Sunday” for the men’s NCAA Tournament and the following day being the same for the women.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“We’re hoping that the tournament will have another boost on that spotlight,” men’s basketball coach Steve Donahue said. “There’s only one other major [championship game] that Sunday, and that’s the Big Ten. We’re going to be on a major network, and I think we’ll show out well.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	And with that rise in national attention, the conference tournament could bring a benefit which the Ivy League has never seen on the men’s side: two NCAA Tournament bids. While the Ancient Eight women finally broke this barrier in 2016 when both Penn and Princeton qualified, the conference has never seen two men’s teams in March Madness in the league’s 62-season history.
        </p>
        <p>
        	But now that the top regular season team is no longer guaranteed a March Madness spot, it’s very possible for the league’s best overall team to be left out, potentially opening the door for the Ancient Eight to claim its first at-large bid on the men’s side.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“It could happen. ... A team’s going to have to play a schedule that’s really good, and win a lot of those games &mdash; and then get upset in the [conference] tournament,” Donahue said. “We’re knocking on the door as a conference ... and the thought is that playing the conference tournament will help us achieve [two NCAA bids] at some point.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	Of course, the downside of the new system lies in the potential weakening of the regular season’s importance. Up until this season, the Ivy League’s claim to fame over the rest of the nation was the raw emotion coming from the fact that a loss in any given conference matchup could eliminate a team from contention for the NCAA Tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
        	But with that special caveat being taken away, one could easily argue that the vivid passion that has historically distinguished the Ivy League’s regular season from the 31 other Division I conferences will fade.
        </p>
        <p>
        	For example, in each of the past three seasons, Penn and Princeton women’s basketball have been the league’s top two teams, with their regular season series determining the recipient of an automatic NCAA berth. This March, both teams entered a showdown at 12-1 in conference play, putting an automatic NCAA spot at stake &mdash; and after Penn prevailed 62-60 in one of the most frenetic games in program history, an emotional McLaughlin said, “It doesn’t get any better than this.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	But if one takes a look inside the minds of the Red and Blue, it’s clear that there’s no such concern about any drop in emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“Absolutely not,” women’s senior point guard Kasey Chambers said. “To have a rivalry like that ... you just don’t lose it. Every game feels like it’s a rivalry game &mdash; but especially us against Princeton &mdash; so it’ll be what it’s always been.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	Additionally, while a drop in importance could theoretically exist at the top of the conference, the tournament won’t have that impact across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Whereas the difference between fourth and fifth place was negligible until this season, that sliver in the standings will now be the difference between going home and experiencing win-or-go-home play &mdash; a gap that might be particularly relevant for a Penn men’s team that came up a single point shy of fourth place in 2015-16 and was predicted to finish fourth in the 2016-17 Ivy preseason media poll.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“I was texting a few guys that played here and they said, ‘Man, that would’ve been so cool,’ ... These kids have a four-year window to play postseason basketball, winner-take-all,” Donahue said. “Our guys are really excited about it, and the regular season still matters. This year we’re home that last regular season weekend, and it’s amazing to think, ‘If we win this weekend, we’re home again on Friday.’”
        </p>
        <p>
        	And even for a Penn women’s team for which it’d be an understatement to call the league’s favorite, there will be no laying off the gas pedal.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“When we get into the Ivy games, we’ll take it one game at a time,” junior forward Michelle Nwokedi said. “If there’s ever a time you rest, that’s when it slips away.”
        </p>
        <p>
        	Still, while winning every game is innately the goal for both teams, knowing what a top-four finish can bring is bound to make the Quakers’ eyes get bigger as crunch time nears.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“Know when [a changed approach] will happen? It’ll happen at some point in February where I would never allow my team to do anything but think about the next game,” Donahue said. “Now I can be all, ‘Yo fellas, here’s what we got; let’s work our tails off these next four days, because these two games could change our season.’”
        </p>
        <p>
        	Ultimately, conference tournament or not, there’s no question that regular season titles and March Madness appearances will continue to be highly sought-after &mdash; and both Donahue and McLaughlin’s programs are set on adding to the already pristine collection of both inside the Palestra.
        </p>
        <p>
        	“I think the competitive nature of our athletes probably doesn’t shift that much. They want to play, and we won’t overlook anything,” McLaughlin said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I think that we’ll play each game like it’s our last &mdash; just like we always do.”
