        <p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >While Penn basketball recruits some of the best athletes from around the country, it’s hard not to notice that the Red and Blue’s 2016-17 roster includes three underclassmen all hailing from the same small institution&nbsp;–&nbsp;the Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >With an enrollment of only 660 students, NMH has become an impressive feeder school for Penn coach Steve Donahue’s program since he took the helm just a year ago.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >Sophomores Jackson Donahue and Collin McManus, as well as freshman AJ Brodeur, all&nbsp;played together at NMH before arriving at Penn.</span>

<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >Despite its size, NMH basketball has turned itself into a high school powerhouse in recent years, sending dozens of players to Division I programs, especially in the Ivy League.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >All three credit Northfield’s head coach, John Carroll, as the central contributing factor to the team’s dominance and the success of its many players transitioning to college basketball.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >“John Carroll recruits kids that would be interested in Ivy League schools, and by that I mean high character, high class individuals who have talent in basketball,” Brodeur said. “For the last few years, [NMH] has been producing Ivy League basketball players better than anyone else in the country."</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >Donahue agreed, and credited both Carroll’s basketball program and NMH’s rigorous academics as reasons why so many of the school's&nbsp;players end up in the Ancient Eight.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >“I came into NMH right as it was beginning to get that name as a top program. Really it’s about the culture up there. Coach Carroll does a phenomenal job of distinguishing which kids he wants playing for him,&nbsp;and that quality of basketball and academics is important for college basketball as well,” Donahue said. “Being exposed to that academic system &mdash; one where you take a day of courses that resembles what you take in college &mdash; gets you situated into the way a rigorous college day goes. And it’s also one of the top high school basketball programs, so all that together just screams 'Ivy League.'”</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >Despite being teammates in high school, each player’s decision to come to Penn seems to have been made independently of the other two.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >"I wouldn’t say they played no role in my decision to come here, but at the end of the day I wanted to do what was best for me in my basketball career. It was the first time I felt it was okay&nbsp;to be selfish, to do what was best for me and go where I felt most comfortable,” Brodeur said. “But with all that said, having Jackson and Colin here, along with Coach Donahue, made it seem more comfortable for me to come. All that, along with my visits here, I fell in love with the campus and the city of Philadelphia and by the end of my recruiting process the decision was really clear to me.”</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >Upon their arrival at Penn, teaming up with each other once again could make the college game feel more comfortable, easing the inevitable adjustment period all young D-I basketball players must endure&nbsp;coming out of high school.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >“We already have great chemistry coming in. Our roles here are very similar to what we had at NMH together,” Brodeur said. “Colin was the big five, big man down low, I’m an inside-out four guy, and Jackson is the shooter on the outside to clean up our mess. It’s been great being able to transfer our skills here, and having&nbsp;our third year now&nbsp;playing organized basketball together will be a huge advantage to us.”</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >For Donahue, the chance to play against former teammates is another unique opportunity that playing at NMH has provided him after coming to Penn. According to NMH's website, the school had a staggering 11 alumni on Ivy League men's basketball rosters during the 2015-16 season.</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >“Knowing that a lot of guys that came ahead of me went to an Ivy League school was really special,” he said. “When you get into conference play, almost every game you play against has guys that you played with in high school. I think it’s so special and something not a lot of teams or conferences can say.”</span>
</p>
<p class="DP Article 2014">
	<span >Although it may be surprising that such a small prep school could produce enough talent to fill roster spots across the Ancient Eight, it appears as though this Penn-NMH connection is no fluke.&nbsp;And if you ask any of the three members of the Red and Blue who have been a part of it, they would tell you to not be surprised if this rapidly growing link between the two programs is here to stay.</span>
