        <h2>Steve Donahue continues to impose influence, experience in second year at Penn</h2>
        <h5>By Tom Nowlan</h5>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/54774_donahuef.jpg" class="img img-responsive" />
        <br>
        <p>
	For Penn basketball coach Steve Donahue, this will be his second year at Penn. But not really.
</p>
<p>
	Rather, the leader of the men’s squad has an extensive history with the Quakers and Philadelphia basketball writ large. A native of Philly suburb Springfield Township, the coach played his college ball at Ursinus before eventually finding his way in 1990 to an assistant position with the Quakers, a job he held for ten years.
</p>
<p>
	Donahue then went on to head coaching gigs at Cornell (with success) and Boston College (with less success). After the Eagles fired him following the 2013-14 season, he took a season off before being named Jerome Allen’s successor in the spring of 2015.
</p>

    </script>

</center>
<p>
	“We’re going to recruit high-character kids that play an extremely fast, skilled, gritty and smart style of basketball,” Donahue said at his introductory press conference. “I hope that you can look out and, even if we didn’t have uniforms on, you would know that it is a Penn basketball team.”
</p>
<p>
	That concept of system-dominated, selfless basketball defined the Quakers’ style a year ago. After Allen’s system had relied heavily on isolation, star-led, jumpshooting offense &mdash; a style focused largely on guard Tony Hicks &mdash; Donahue implemented a pass-heavy attack geared towards dribble-drives and three-point shooting. The team increased its assists per game 16 percent over Allen’s final season while upping their total three-point makes 29 percent.
</p>
<p>
	Those results are largely due to a cast of players that fit into that mold. This year’s sophomores &mdash; Donahue’s “classmates” so to speak &mdash; have emerged as the heart and soul of the team’s offense. Guard Jake Silpe and sharpshooter Jackson Donahue (of no relation to the coach), both saw extensive minutes as freshmen. Donahue led the team in three-point field goals and percentage while Silpe, starting at point guard for the majority of the season, led the team in assists.
</p>
<p>
	“Ever since he’s been in the program, I’ve been here too,” Silpe said of his coach. “So I understand the way he coaches and everything. There’s lots of similarities there.”
</p>
<p>
	“Practices are intense &mdash; nothing is for granted &hellip; It’s businesslike,” the guard added.
</p>
<p>
	This year will be the first in which Donahue will get to lead players he has personally recruited &mdash; in addition to freshman standouts such as forward AJ Brodeur, the team will add junior transfers Matt MacDonald and Caleb Wood, both of whom are likely to get significant minutes.
</p>
<p>
	“When I came on my recruiting visit, Coach said I would be a big part of the offense; probably the starting one or two guard and playing 30-35 minutes per game,” Wood, a transfer from tiny Lassen Community College in Susanville, Ca., said. “And all the freshmen are really good – they’re bringing lots of competition in practice. They’re gonna be big pieces.”
</p>
<p>
	But, while Donahue’s scheme is largely tailored towards the team’s younger and newer faces, veteran stars such as senior Matt Howard – the team’s leading returning scorer – will still play a major role, and have noticed their coach settling in to the new position well.
</p>
<p>
	“There are plenty of differences when you get a new head coach,” Howard acknowledged, pointing to increased outside shooting as a major Allen/Donahue difference.
</p>
<p>
	“But he does definitely seem way more comfortable this year. He knows exactly what the game plan will be every day.”
</p>
<p>
	So, as the coach goes into his second year looking to improve on the team’s 5-9 record of a season ago, Penn fans have reason for long-term optimism &mdash; after all, Cornell won just three conference games in Donahue’s first season.
</p>
<p>
	But perhaps most importantly, Donahue has a bit more experience than just one season would seem to indicate.
</p>
<p>
	Because, keep in mind, he is hardly a stranger to Penn basketball.
