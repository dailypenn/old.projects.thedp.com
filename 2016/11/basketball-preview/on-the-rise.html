        <h2>Buchta | Penn's basketball programs are on the rise</h2>
        <h5>By Nick Buchta</h5>
        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/54831_bookscolumnf.jpg" class="img img-responsive" />
        <br>
        <p>
	The times, they are a’changing. An Ivy Tournament is on the way, Bob Dylan is getting the Nobel Prize, Penn women’s basketball is the runaway favorite to win the league and the men’s side is decisively middle-of-the-pack.
</p>
<p>
	This is a weird landscape for Ivy League basketball, but it has been comprised of a series of positive developments for the Quakers.
</p>
<p>
	For now, the conference tournament is a good thing. In 2017, it will be held at the Palestra. There has been no announcement on future host sites, but anywhere other than University City would do a disservice to the tournament itself. No other Ancient Eight venue can realistically hold the event, and attempting to rent out an arena would be untenable.
</p>
<p>
	So, hopefully we’ll see the tournament in the Palestra for years to come. For now, we’ll settle for it being right here.
</p>
<p>
	And no team stands to benefit more from the tournament than Penn men’s basketball.
</p>
<p>
	Steve Donahue is entering year two, and things are looking up. Darien Nelson-Henry is a large, bearded loss, and it's unclear who has the size to replace him in the paint, but freshman AJ Brodeur figures to be a force for the Quakers right from the get-go.
</p>
<p>
	They also return Matt Howard to go along with the sophomore squad of Jake Silpe, Jackson Donahue and Max Rothschild. Add transfers Caleb Wood and Matt MacDonald to the equation, and this team is better positioned to compete than they have at any point in recent years.
</p>
<p>
	That said, the regular season title seems like a stretch, which is where the tournament comes in. The Ivy preseason poll has the Red and Blue set to finish fourth, which seems about right. They could well over-perform, but fourth or fifth is about the floor for this team. The nice thing is, this year, fourth might just be good enough. An NCAA bid may be improbable, but a tournament run might just make it possible.
</p>
<p>
	And speaking of tournament runs, Penn women’s basketball is the unanimous pick to repeat as Ivy champs. That also sounds about right. The Quakers return all five starters from a year ago and have added some potentially key pieces in center Emily Anderson and guard Phoebe Sterba.
</p>
<p>
	Sydney Stipanovich is the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, and she’s back for one more run. She’s already checked off a lot of boxes in her time here with one exception: get an NCAA Tournament win.
</p>
<p>
	Last year, the Quakers came up just short in a dogfight against Washington, who eventually made its way to the Final Four. If Mike McLaughlin and Co. are ever going to nab the program’s first-ever tournament win, this year offers a better chance to do it than any other.
</p>
<p>
	Historically, this supplement has been devoted to the men’s program. That’ll happen when Penn and Princeton took 41 Ivy titles between 1963 and 2007.
</p>
<p>
	Last year, the decision was made to make this a two-team supplement. We don’t plan to reverse that.
</p>
<p>
	These are two programs in different spots, but they are both headed in the same direction: upward.
</p>
<p>
	That doesn’t mean there aren’t question marks.
</p>
<p>
	McLaughlin is going to have some tough personnel decisions to make. Sterba has seen a lot of early action in practice and scrimmages, but how quickly can she be trusted to stick around the primary rotation? Can anyone come off the bench to finally find ways to give Stipanovich a rest mid-game? That’s not to say the Quakers are in a bad spot &mdash; but the decision that needs to be made will make or break this team in what will be a tough Ivy slog.
</p>
<p>
	Donahue is still largely operating with Jerome Allen’s recruits. He finally has some of his own, but none seem ready to really fill the big man role DNH left behind. Donahue himself cast doubt on the readiness of just about all of his freshmen to get playing time early &mdash; but when he really has only Matt Howard as a senior who sees the court much, Penn will need to rely on those young guys at some point.
</p>
<p>
	All of this will be broken down throughout the rest of the supplement. If nothing else, there is one main takeaway from it all: Things are looking up.
