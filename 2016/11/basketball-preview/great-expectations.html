	The ball goes off the backboard. Michelle Nwokedi grabs the board for the Blue squad and dishes it out as her teammates go up court. A few passes later, Nwokedi finds the net on a turnaround layup.
</p>
<p>
	The Red squad knew it was coming, but it didn’t matter. A minute later, the whistle blows and the team regroups. Practice ends, and the team mills about after another day squaring off against its toughest opponent: itself.
</p>
<p>
	It’s no secret that Penn women’s basketball is the runaway favorite to repeat as Ivy League champions &mdash; they were the unanimous selection to do so in the conference’s preseason media poll. For the first time in the Mike McLaughlin era, they come into the year receiving votes in the NCAA Coaches Poll.
</p>
<p>
	Expectations are high, and they should be. The team returns all five starters from a year ago, and at least two freshmen &mdash; center Emily Anderson and guard Phoebe Sterba &mdash; figure to be factors almost from the get-go.

<p>
	Thinking back to Mike McLaughlin’s first season in University City &mdash; just eight years ago &mdash; it’s hard to imagine a team like this.
</p>
<p>
	<hr>
</p>
<p>
	Save for a five-year stretch of Diana Caramanico and Jewel Clark-led greatness, Penn women’s basketball had struggled for most of its existence. In 23 of the program’s first 35 seasons, it finished fourth or worse in the conference. Prior to McLaughlin’s arrival, the team had hoisted the Ivy trophy just twice since the inaugural 1974 season.
</p>
<p>
	In 2009-10, McLaughlin’s first at the helm, things got worse. The team went 1-13 in conference play, the worst Ivy record in program history. The 6-20 overall record remains the worst of McLaughlin’s 25-year career.
</p>
<p>
	His previous worst season? 25-8 in his rookie campaign at Holy Family.
</p>
<p>
	“I like to hope I’m consistent, I like to hope my message has been the same from the first day I took over in 2009 when, frankly, we had a lot of work to do to even win a game to where we are now,” McLaughlin said. “But, of course, as the players have improved and the expectation level has risen, hopefully I’m consistently the same.”
</p>
<p>
	Fortunately for McLaughlin, he was working in the one part of Philadelphia that trusted the process.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s definitely more of a winning atmosphere, the girls have more of a business-like attitude and that’s just something that he’s created,” Penn assistant coach Kate Slover said in March before the team’s NCAA Tournament appearance. Slover, who was a senior at Penn for McLaughlin’s 6-20 season, came back to work with him in 2014 after several years coaching high school ball. “I mean, even our senior year, even with practices, it was always, ‘Let’s get in, let’s get our work done,’ but it’s definitely the same now.”
</p>
<p>
	Things got better every year. Eighth place turned into sixth place turned into fifth place turned into third. And in 2013-14, the breakthrough occurred.
</p>
<p>
	Headlined by senior Alyssa Baron, McLaughlin’s first recruiting class led Penn to its third-ever Ivy title &mdash; and a halftime lead at the NCAA Tournament against fifth-seeded Texas. The Longhorns would pull away in the second half, but a message had been delivered.
</p>
<p>
	Penn women’s basketball had arrived.
</p>
<p>
	<hr>
</p>
<p>
	It was 2014-15 that was the turning point. On the heels of an Ivy title, the Quakers were simply outmatched by Courtney Banghart’s Princeton squad. The Tigers breezed to a 30-0 record and a No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament.
</p>
<p>
	Neither of the two contests between the two rivals was all that close. A 29-point loss opened up Ivy play and a 13-point loss closed it out. At the snap of a finger, it felt as though Penn had gone from the cream of the conference to a mile behind Princeton.
</p>
<p>
	The Quakers had to settle for a WNIT bid and a second-round exit after a loss to Temple.
</p>
<p>
	“I’ve been on both sides of it,” McLaughlin said. “I’ve won before and [the] next year, the expectations are different. I think you manage the expectations head on.”
</p>
<p>
	Instead of settling behind Princeton for second, the Red and Blue responded ferociously in 2015-16. After a single voter predicted they would take the Ancient Eight crown, Penn beat Princeton not once, but twice, going 13-1 in Ivy play and capping off the best three-year run in program history with another title.
</p>
<p>
	“When we start looking at other teams, you see familiar faces and it gets a little bit more personal,” senior forward Jackie Falconer said. “And just to be able to come back and do it for a second time, we realize that it’s a rare opportunity, so we felt really lucky to be there and it was a really good moment for us.”
</p>
<p>
	With last year’s title, the onus was not on Penn &mdash; it had been on Princeton. The Tigers were the ones coming off of the perfect season, but the Quakers were hungry for more. They got it. And with it, they saw a changed program.
</p>
<p>
	Gone were the days where a top-three finish every few years was good enough. The dynamic of the team has shifted entirely. The conversation is no longer if the Red and Blue can compete &mdash; it’s who can compete with them.
</p>
<p>
	<hr>
</p>
<p>
	That brings it to present day. Back in the Weightman Hall gym. Back to battling against themselves.
</p>
<p>
	The Quakers have a few more days before they head to Cameron Indoor Stadium to open the year at Duke.
</p>
<p>
	“It’s a new season. What happened last year, happened last year,” Nwokedi, the junior forward, said. “We’re going to remember it, we’re going to acknowledge it, but it’s a new season, new team and we’re just ready to take it each game at a time like we did last year.”
</p>
<p>
	But this year’s success is not just about the program anymore. It’s about what the players still have left to do.
</p>
<p>
	Senior center Sydney Stipanovich seems like she’s already done it all. She’s the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, three-time Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, the program’s career blocks leader and is just 44 away from setting the all-time conference mark.
</p>
<p>
	She’s played in two NCAA Tournaments, a WNIT and won a Big 5 title. She’s been a part of half of all Ivy titles in program history. So what’s left?
</p>
<p>
	An NCAA run.
</p>
<p>
	If any Penn women’s basketball team is set to do it, it’s this one.
</p>
<p>
	“There are a lot of things that are going to happen between now and March,” McLaughlin said. “This part of their careers right now for Sydney, Jackie and [senior guard] Kasey [Chambers] are pretty special and I don’t want to put any stress on them. I want them to play as hard as they can, enjoy this, be the best team they possibly could be.”
</p>
<p>
	Especially for the three seniors &mdash; Stipanovich, Falconer and Chambers &mdash; the season has a dual purpose. It is no longer simply about playing in the moment &mdash; though their coach emphasizes the importance of doing so.
</p>
<p>
	There’s no way to avoid the reality that the players are operating on borrowed time.
</p>
<p>
	<hr>
</p>
<p>
	No matter what happens, by this time next season, Stipanovich will be gone. Falconer will be gone. Chambers will be gone. But Penn women’s basketball will remain.
</p>
<p>
	“We have such a good group of people that are all really passionate about Penn basketball, so it makes our lives really easy,” Falconer said. “Everyone comes ready to play every day so it’s just being there when some of the younger kids may have a bad practice &mdash; and we’ve all been there before.”
</p>
<p>
	The legacy that is going to be established extends beyond the final record this year. Come May, the Quakers will lose their center and their point guard &mdash; both in many ways the heart and soul of the team.
</p>
<p>
	“One of the first things that coach ever said to me was that when you come to Penn, you can either have a positive impact or a negative impact or no impact,” Falconer said. “And our goal as a senior class is just to have as big of a positive impact as we can.”
</p>
<p>
	The expectations have changed for the program in the last eight years. The upperclassmen have contributed largely to that shift, but it’s something that has to be sustained &mdash; it is not self-perpetuating. After Kelly Greenberg accepted a job at Boston University in 2004 following her second Ivy title in four years, the Quakers didn’t finish better than fourth over the next nine years.
</p>
<p>
	While the right players can come together with the right coach at the right time, the Quakers are conscious that they must actively work to continue the cycle, particularly with their newest additions/youngest players.
</p>
<p>
	“[Anderson] learning from Sydney, who’s probably the most professional kid that is probably going to come through this program, so these are all going to add up to her,” McLaughlin noted. “She may not get it all right now, but she’s going to reflect back on it, that ‘I got a chance to play with Sydney and how humbled and professional her work ethic is, asking questions after practice.’
</p>
<p>
	“I think it’s going to help Emily now, I think it’s going to help Phoebe now, they just won’t get it as easily now as they’ll get it down the road.”
</p>
<p>
	That’s at the heart of this season for Penn women’s basketball. The expectations game has changed. But the veterans know they can succeed. It’s up to them just as much as McLaughlin.
</p>
<p>
	It doesn’t matter what games are on tap and what trips are being planned.
</p>
<p>
	The only opponent that matters is internal.
