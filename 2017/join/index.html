              content for factual accuracy, as well as grammar, style and
              mechanics. Our editors work across departments to put together

              What is 34th Street, you might ask? Why, it’s Penn’s one and only Arts,
              Culture and Campus magazine—home of smart, well–informed, and creative
              nonfiction content, written by some fabulously interesting and cool people.
              It’s a catalyst of conversation, a voice for the voiceless, and Penn’s most
              compelling journalistic narrator. We're thankful to have so many excited
              and passionate people working for us this semester. We hope that you'll
              be one of them. We're looking for writers, photographers, designers,
              marketers, videographers and pun experts. Email
              <a href="mailto:greenberg@dailypennsylvanian.com">greenberg@34st.com</a> to get involved.</p>

              UTB is Penn’s humor site! We post satire, commentary on news and Penn
              goings-on, lists, photos, and anything else that will make you say
              "that's pretty funny and/or good." UTB delivers fresh, humorous perspectives
              on things relevant to the Penn student body, and highlights the often-ridiculous
              nature of the Penn experience. From an Amy Gutmann GoFundMe to an Oz Christmas
              playlist, and any and all Canada Goose content, we aim to comment on the world
              as we know it through humor.
            </p>
            <p>
              We pull from all over Penn—all years, all schools, no experience necessary.
              If you're looking to share your creativity with the Penn community and the
              world, if you want to join a team of talented and interesting individuals, or
              if people who aren't your extended family tell you that you're funny, this is
              the place for you.
