            In our three-and-a-half years working at The Daily Pennsylvanian, close to 10 students have died by suicide, a statistic as remarkable to write as it is now commonplace to hear across campus. With each email from some Penn administrator, we have grown to numb ourselves to feeling pain, to mourning the death of someone close to us, to finally attaching a name to the problem of mental illness endemic to so many at Penn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental health is an intensely personal topic, shaped inexorably by the circumstances, preferences and lifestyle of an individual person. A conversation about mental health can take a variety of forms. What it cannot tolerate is silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            For months, the DP and Street have been coordinating a day completely devoted to coverage of mental health.
          </p>
          <p>
            By no less than a happy accident, the publication of our special issue on mental health falls on the same day as a “Campus Conversation” organized by Penn administrators to discuss “what we can do, individually and collectively, to take care of ourselves and others and to foster individual and community resilience.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In announcing the event, Penn officials wrote, “A community that values wellness, community support, and resilience is best poised to find creative and constructive solutions to our challenges.” We could not agree more with the spirit of this statement and hope that in these pieces, interested readers can find a multitude of ways to begin confronting those difficult, necessary challenges.
          </p>

                  Penn administrators have worked to improve policies
                  surrounding mental health, but gaps still exist. These
                  articles examine the policies that are in place, how they
                  serve students, how they don’t and whether they’re enough.

                But I do think we can always try to do more in our everyday lives to just be kind to one another. It doesn’t cost any time or energy to smile at the person walking into Van Pelt as you’re walking out. No one will ever be worse off if you tell your friends you love them just a little more often. Ask a friend how they’re doing. You may not know it, but that person might breathe a whole lot easier because of you.

                Student-athletes at Penn have some of the hardest jobs in the world.  They wake up early. They practice in the evenings so they have to stay up late to work. They sometimes have to cut or gain significant weight in a short period of time. They get injured — and they often play through it. They get concussions, and later in their lives, many of them suffer long-term consequences from it.
