          With students running around in suits to Huntsman Hall, coffee chats across campus and Career Service emails populated with prestigious company names, hunting for a job is a daily part of life at Penn. Over the course of a few months, the Enterprise team at The Daily Pennsylvanian has looked into the many aspects of the job search on campus. From students working in lucrative industries to those who return to Locust Walk to continue their work at Penn, here are their stories.

            Students who choose to break the mold and try something different after graduation often end up pursuing a range of interests. Out of the approximately 11 percent of 2016 Penn graduates who did not go on immediately to a full-time job or a spot at graduate school, 4 percent were seeking employment, 2 percent were seeking to continue their education, while the rest were employed part-time, joining the military or engaged in volunteer services.

            After graduation, 59 percent of the university’s graduates were employed full-time, based on the students that responded to the Career Service survey. Wharton graduates had the highest rate of full-time employment, 88 percent, while College graduates had the lowest at 66.1 percent. Both the College and Engineering had roughly 20 percent of graduates continuing their education and Nursing had the highest rate of students, 9 percent, still seeking work.

New York University, Harvard University and Columbia University have also maintained their spot as popular schools for Penn graduates since 2011.

            Career Service data between 2011 and 2016 consistently places finance, consulting and technology as the top three industries for Penn graduates with full-time employment. While the percentage of students that go into finance and consulting has remained relatively steady across the six years, hovering around 50 percent, there has been a notable increase in the percentage of students who go into technology — while seven percent of Penn graduates with full-time offers went into technology in 2011, 15 percent of 2016 graduates with a full-time job entered the technology sector. The energy, insurance and government sectors remain one of least represented industries across the six years among Penn graduates with a full-time job offer.

            For some undergraduates, the allure of a prestigious position in finance, consulting and technology — the three industries that more than half of Penn students go into — can outweigh the demands of the job. Some find themselves applying for or even accepting jobs even when they’re not fully sure of what the job entails. But what is life truly like for Penn graduates in these lucrative industries?

            While nearly half of 2016 Penn graduates who took full-time jobs worked in consulting or finance, only around a quarter of 2016 Harvard, Yale and Princeton graduates entered these two industries. But, despite the promise of lucrative paychecks that can climb into the six-digit realm, the appeal of consulting and finance careers at Penn is only partly due to money. There’s something else at play, too — prestige.

            Between 2011 and 2016, top employers for Penn graduates overall has consistently been consulting companies, finance companies and the university. While Goldman Sachs was the top employer from 2011-2013, with 33 to 42 graduates accepting employment offers each year, Penn and its health systems have recently overtaken the company to become the top university employer for the last three years. Other top employers of Penn graduates across the six years include the Boston Consulting Group and Deloitte.

            Career Services data over the past six years consistently lists Penn as being one of the top employers for recent university graduates – between 16 and 43 students are employed full-time each year since 2010. And even more Penn students-turned-staffers haven’t even made it onto that list; they’re part time Penn workers who juggle other jobs, and their lives seem just as packed, productive and on par with those of the undergraduates they now answer to.
