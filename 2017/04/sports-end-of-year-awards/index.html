      <h1>PENN ATHLETICS END OF YEAR AWARDS</h1>
      <p style="max-width: 700px;">
        It's been a fantastic year for Penn Athletics to date. The school has brought in five team league championships — with two more potentially coming from spring teams women's lacrosse and baseball. Individuals from women's squash, cross country, fencing and more have dominated on the national stage. Decades-long title droughts have been broken; equally lengthy individual school records have fallen.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 700px;">
        The year has seen some incredible moments for the University — but which ones were best? Here are our year-end awards for the best athletes, coaches, upsets and more.

          <p>
            Penn football's Alek Torgersen might take the honor of being the first Quaker to be drafted to the NFL in over a decade this weekend, but if he doesn't, then wide receiver Justin Watson will surely have a chance next year. This season, the junior led the Ivy League in receiving touchdowns with eight, total receiving yards with 1,115 and also topped the yards/game category by an astounding 40 yards.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also registered the third highest total running yards on the team — behind only running back Tre Solomon and Torgersen. With his rushing and catching statistics combined, he led the league in all-purpose yards by over 100.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watson made some memorable plays throughout Penn's season, always making himself a game-changer. The team could not have successfully defended its Ivy League title, for instance, without his game-winning touchdown catch in the last 30 seconds of the Quakers'   thriller against Harvard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watson was honored for his outstanding season for the Quakers by being voted the runner-up in the race for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. And for standing so tall above his team and the Ivy League in one of its most competitive sports, Justin Watson has surely earned Male Athlete of the Year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honorable mention: Mark Andrew (swimming), Jake Cousins (baseball), Tim Graul (baseball), Frank Mattiace (wrestling), Mike McCurdy (sprint football), Alek Torgersen (football), Justin Yoo (fencing)

          <h2>Best Female Athlete: Michelle Nwokedi</h2>

          <p>
            Ivy Player of the Year. Ivy Tournament MVP. Averaged nearly a double-double over an entire season. Team leader in points, rebounds and blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those are just some of the many achievements from a dominant season from Penn women's basketball's Michelle Nwokedi. Her final stat line was 14.6 points, 9.1 rebounds and 2.8 blocks per game on 41.6 percent shooting, but her impact goes beyond the numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            All year, Nwokedi was an imposing presence on both sides of the ball. On offense, she was the team's leading scorer, with the ability to get inside at will while also pulling up for an outside jumper. The threat of Nwokedi scoring from any point on the floor kept opponents on their toes at all time, and opened up shots for her teammates. On defense, she was a force protecting the rim, leading the Ivy League with 85 blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more impressively, when the Quakers needed her most, especially during Ivy play, she stepped up her game. The junior forward had a stretch in the heart of Ivy play with six straight double-doubles, and in the two Ivy tournament games she combined for 40 points and 25 rebounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without Nwokedi, Penn does not repeat as Ivy champs. Her efforts allowed the Quakers to steamroll through the Ivy League, and for that, she earns Best Female Athlete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honorable mention: Alex Condon (lacrosse), Alexa Hoover (field hockey), Taylor McCorkle (track and field), Caroline Moore (gymnastics), Reeham Salah (squash), Alexis Sargent (softball)

          <p>
            From the minute AJ Brodeur stepped on campus, those following Penn men’s basketball knew that he had the potential to be special. Standing at an imposing 6-foot-8 and weighing 225 pounds, possessing lateral quickness and surprising speed, Brodeur had all the tools to become a dominant big man someday for Penn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, it's hard to imagine anybody thought he’d be this good, this soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting all 28 games for the Quakers, Brodeur averaged 13.8 points per game and 6.9 rebounds per game to lead the team in both categories. Additionally, he blocked a school-record 66 shots and paced the entire Ivy League in blocks per game with 2.4.
          </p>
          <p>
            His dominance was rewarded with numerous accolades, including four Ivy League Rookie of the Week awards, an Ivy League Player of the Week award, two Big 5 Player of the Week awards, and a second team All-Ivy selection.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            A freshman getting serious playing time on a varsity team is impressive. A freshman being one of her team’s most important players is even more rare. But for a freshman to be unequivocally the best at her position in school history is simply unheard of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until Maura Kimmel came along.
          </p>
          <p>
            The freshman women’s track and field phenom wasted absolutely no time making her mark on the Red and Blue program, already holding a pair of school records — yes, for all classes — without even having completed her first season yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            During indoor season, Kimmel made an impression right off the bat, breaking the indoor shot put record on several occasions to put the nation on notice. Her best mark, one of 15.19 meters, stands more than a meter above the next highest throw in the event — indoor or outdoor — in Penn women’s track and field history.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as the team transitioned to outdoor meets, Kimmel hasn’t slowed down a bit. She also has set the school’s discus record on numerous occasions (currently standing at 48.43 meters, more than six feet ahead of second place and fellow freshman Isis Trotman). And though she doesn’t hold the outdoor shot record yet, it seems like a mere formality for her to catch 2014 grad Theresa Picciallo, as only seven inches separate the two right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though many freshmen have stood out, none others can make a legitimate claim for G.O.A.T. status just yet, and for that, Kimmel is the easy choice as Female Rookie of the Year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honorable mention: Erin Barry (lacrosse), Emma Cullen (gymnastics), Jess Davis (squash), Caroline Furrer (volleyball), Alexa Schneck (field hockey)

          <h2>Best Team: Sprint Football</h2>

          <p>
            Several teams have legitimate claims to being Penn’s best sports team this year, but in the end, there could only be one.
          </p>
          <p>
            And after a season that saw Penn sprint football run the table for only the second time in school history, this honor had to go to them. After all, can any other Penn team say that when it was all said and done, they were the national champions?
          </p>
          <p>
            And while it is true that only seven teams compete nationally, winning the Collegiate Sprint Football League is no easy feat. Without any playoffs, a single regular season loss can spell the end of a team’s championship hopes — especially if a team does not want to have to share their championship.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Quakers nearly learned this the hard way — on several occasions. While their season saw the Red and Blue beat some teams handily, there were multiple instances where other opponents looked well on their way to victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            But each time, Penn rallied. Taking one game at a time, the Quakers methodically inched closer and closer to perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the dust finally settled with a blowout win over Post, legendary coach Bill Wagner and league MVP senior quarterback Mike McCurdy finally had one more thing to celebrate.

          <h2>Biggest Upset: Sprint Football over Army</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/59109_biggestupsetsprintfootballf.jpg" alt="Sprint Football">
          <p class="credit">Alex Fisher / The Daily Pennsylvanian</p>
          <p>
            When defending champion Army visited in late September, Penn sprint football knew that it would have to win to keep its championship hopes alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though it was only the Quakers’ second game of the season, the Collegiate Sprint Football League (CSFL) does not have a postseason, so one loss can ruin an entire season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of Penn’s locker room, though, not many were giving the Quakers a chance. After all, Penn had not beaten Army since 2008 — including a double-overtime loss to lose the league title in 2015 — and the Black Knights had only lost once since 2011.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all the odds stacked against them, the Red and Blue easily could have folded under the pressure. Instead, they battled.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the very beginning, Penn made it clear that it wouldn’t be bullied. The Quakers forced a three-and-out on Army’s opening possession and scored a touchdown on their own first drive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in the half, the Black Knights marched 76 yards down the field all the way to Penn’s 6-yard line. With their backs against the wall, the Red and Blue’s defense came up with the biggest stop of the game. Instead of giving up the final few yards, the Quakers turned Army over on downs and responded right back with a touchdown drive of its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of a sudden the score was 14-3 and Penn looked well on its way to a mammoth upset. The Black Knights rallied to have a chance to win the game in the final minute, but Penn’s defense stopped them in their tracks once again with a Quinn Karam interception.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the win, the Quakers showed the rest of the CSFL that they were the team to beat and set the tone for the rest of their undefeated championship season.
          </p>

          <h2>Best Record-Breaking Performance: Sydney Stipanovich breaks Ivy League career blocks record</h2>
          <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.dpn/59115_recordbreakingstipf.jpg" alt="Sydney Stipanovich">
          <p class="credit">Ilana Wurman / The Daily Pennsylvanian</p>
          <p>
            From the moment Sydney Stipanovich first stepped on the court for the Quakers back in 2013, it was clear she was a major threat to go down as the greatest shot-blocker in Ivy League history when all was said and done. As a freshman, she had more blocked shots than six of the seven other TEAMS en route to the second-highest single-season total in league history.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time her senior year rolled around, she was the Quakers' all-time leader, single-season leader and single-game leader in the category, as well as the single-game record-holder for the entire Ivy League. It was only a matter of time before she became the Ivy League's all-time career blocks leader, and she did that on February 18 against Yale when she swatted away her 306th shot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stipanovich ended her career with a total of 315, and is unquestionably the greatest defensive force in the paint that the league has ever seen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honorable mention: Mark Andrew (Ivy record, 400 IM), AJ Brodeur (single-season blocks), Alexa Hoover (career goals), Maura Kimmel (discus and indoor shotput), Taylor McCorkle (100m and 200m), Mike McCurdy (career passing yards), Alek Torgersen (career passing TDs)

          <h2>Best Championship/Playoff Performance: Frank Mattiace</h2>

          <p>
            Frank Mattiace couldn’t have wanted any situation more than this.
          </p>
          <p>
            12 months earlier, the No. 5 seed then-junior wrestler found himself in the EIWA semifinals at 197 pounds against No. 1 seed and fellow junior Brett Harner of Princeton, and was controversially deducted of two points in a 3-2 loss to the bitter rival and eventual conference champion.
          </p>
          <p>
            So only fate would have it that the two would unite again in the exact same setting — No. 3 seed Mattiace and No. 2 Harner, both as seniors, both going toe-to-toe in the EIWA semis yet again. And with everything at stake on the big stage, Mattiace made sure his revenge would be sweet, winning 4-3 in another thriller to kill off last year’s demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            But amazingly, that wasn’t even the pinnacle of the senior’s run. In the championship match, Mattiace faced off against No. 1 Tom Sleigh of Bucknell and took home the trophy in perhaps the most thrilling match of all, needing two tiebreaker periods after initially being knotted up at 4-4. The win brought Mattiace his first conference title in his career and the school’s first in any weight class since Micah Burak in 2013, making him a clear choice for the Best Championship Performance.

            It had been 43 years since men's cross country had won an Ivy League title. But at this year's Heptagonal Championships, the Quakers obliterated that dry streak, placing all five scorers in the top-12 of the championship race to take the title with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least, it looked easy. But at the three-mile marker of the 8K race, Penn was actually in third, trailing Columbia by 10 points. The Red and Blue surged late on and gained 20 points on their competitors, winning in the end by a gap of 13 points over second-place Princeton.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seniors Nick Tuck and Brendan Shearn kept close throughout the race, pushing each other to finish fourth and fifth, respectively, at just under 24 minutes each. Classmate Chris Hatler and junior Christopher Luciano finished in eighth and ninth, just ten seconds behind the Quakers' top two. With junior Patrick Hally rounding out all of Penn's five scorers in 12th place, it was an unprecedented championship performance from the team, likely to stand out for decades to come in program history.

          <h2>Best Game: Men's Basketball vs. Princeton in the Ivy League Tournament</h2>

          <p>
            The best game of the year in all of Penn Athletics may have been a loss, but it was perhaps the most thrilling game in what is Penn's greatest rivalry: Penn-Princeton basketball. It was the inaugural Ivy League Tournament, and it was in the Palestra. The atmosphere was set for a good game — but what fans got was one for the ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Quakers and the Tigers battled back and forth for the entire game, but it was Penn who led the heavily-favorited Princeton for virtually every single minute of regulation. The nearly sold-out Palestra roared to life every time a basket was scored by the de-facto hosts, and Penn went into halftime up 28-19 after a remarkable first half of defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            That lead held for much of the second half, with the Quakers up by as many as 10 points. But in the end, Princeton, who didn't lead for a single second of regulation, clawed it back to tie it up at 59 apiece in the final seconds to send the game to overtime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Penn collapsed in the added minutes, allowing the Ivy League champions to march on to a 72-64 win, but it was still the most enthralling game of the Quakers' season by a long shot. It was truly a taste of March Madness at its finest — even if they were on the losing end of it.

          <h2>Best Play: Sprint Football's touchdown in double overtime against Cornell</h2>

          <p>
            Penn sprint football won its its outright CSFL title since 2000, so the season had many exciting moments. But the peak of the season, and the best play of the year, came in the double overtime thriller against Cornell, in which the team clinched at least a share of the title.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game itself was a roller coaster: Penn trailed for the majority of the game, but a 93-yard drive in the dying seconds of regulation, and the ensuing two-point conversion, allowed the Quakers to tie the game at 20.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first overtime period saw both teams lose the ball on interceptions, and Penn's second OT try looked to be heading the same way. After driving all the way down to the Cornell's 3-yard line, quarterback Mike McCurdy threw a pass towards one of his receivers in the end zone. But instead of finding its intended receiver, the pass was tipped up by a Cornell linebacker, and he angled to get under the ball for the interception.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's where Penn sophomore lineman Angelo Matos came in to save the day. Standing in the right place at the right time and with a quick reaction, Matos grabbed the ball out of the air to give Penn a miraculous touchdown. The Quakers would stymie Cornell's rebuttal attempt and take home the victory and the title, but the touchdown play was the lasting image from the game.
          </p>

          <h2>Best Moment: Men's Basketball upsets Harvard to secure bid to the Ivy League Tournament after 0-6 start</h2>

          <p>
            On February 7th, Penn men's basketball lost to Princeton to fall to 0-6 in the Ivy League. We even pronounced them dead. With eight games left, though, they were anything but.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Quakers won five of the next seven games, but they still needed to win their last — and for Columbia to lose, too. Both of those events seemed unlikely, as Harvard had just won six of its past seven games, while the surging Lions were playing a struggling Yale team that had lost four of its last six.
          </p>
          <p>
            And with 30 seconds to go, things looked just as bleak for Penn. Harvard tied things up, and the Quakers' best facilitator, Darnell Foreman, fouled out of the game. In for him came Jackson Donahue. Fate was at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donahue hit a three-pointer on Penn's last possession to win the game 75-72, and the Palestra went into hysterics as the impossible dream came true — after being nearly mathematically eliminated from making the Ivy League Tournament, Penn had completed one of the most incredible runs in league history to make it to March Madness on its home court.

          <h2>Best Male Breakthrough Athlete: Louis Vecchio</h2>

          <p>
            With 2015 starting football defensive linemen Lukas Nossem and Dan Connaughton — not to mention outside linebacker and Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Tyler Drake — departing to graduation last spring, there were questions on who would step up and be the guy to help replace all that elite pass rushing talent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turns out, Louis Vecchio was the answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            After securing 11 tackles in eight games as a freshman before missing his nearly his entire sophomore season with an ACL injury, the California native returned to peak form — and then some. Earning a starting job at defensive end, the 6-foot-5 junior thrived right off the bat, but perhaps his most impressive performance came at the most important time.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Penn football one loss shy of Ivy title elimination and hosting undefeated No. 22 Harvard, the breakout star posted the game of his life, intercepting a pass in the backfield and taking it 40 yards to house to give Penn its first touchdown and eventually finishing with six tackles and three sacks in the crucial 27-14 win.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the season, Vecchio secured 35 tackles, including team-highs with 10.5 tackles for losses and 5.5 sacks. He and sophomore cornerback Mason Williams were the lone defensive Quakers to earn first team All-Ivy honors, and for his rapid surge to stardom, Vecchio is our Male Breakthrough Athlete of the Year.

          <p>
            When Caroline Moore was named a team captain as a sophomore — after competing in only five meets in 2016, nonetheless — the decision might have turned some heads outside the team’s locker room.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time Moore’s second season was complete, though, all doubts had long been silenced.
          </p>
          <p>
            Competing in the vault, beam and floor events, the sophomore quickly became her team’s go-to performer, consistently etching her name in the school’s record books.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most impressive individual performance of Moore’s season came in Penn’s second meet against Yale, where the sophomore — while fighting off strep throat — won all three events she competed in, culminating in a vibrant 9.875-point effort on floor that ranked No. 4 in school history, to carry the Red and Blue to an insane comeback win over Yale.
          </p>
          <p>
            But while her floor performance was historically impressive — even more so when considering she didn’t compete in the event once as a freshman — that’s far from all the versatile gymnast was capable of. With stellar performances later in the season, she stands No. 2 in Penn history on vault and No. 4 on beam, earning ECAC Gymnast of the Week honors twice in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the 2017 season kicked off, few outside the Penn program knew Moore’s name. By the time it wrapped up, she was the team’s biggest name. And for that, she’s our Best Female Breakthrough Athlete.

          <p>
            Coming back from an ACL tear is no easy task for an athlete. Emotionally accepting that one’s season is done, physically enduring nearly a year of rehab exercises, mentally re-gaining the confidence to play with the same aggressiveness and passion as he or she did before — getting through it all is an ordeal.
          </p>
          <p>
            So doing that entire process twice? That’s the stuff of Hollywood stories — and it’s also the path of Penn women’s lacrosse junior midfielder Natalie Stefan.
          </p>
          <p>
            After tearing her ACL in high school, Stefan managed to get decent playing as a freshman at Penn. But just as she was set to take a larger role in 2016, it happened again: another devastating knee pop, and another season on the sidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doubts to whether Stefan was capable of making it back to the top would’ve been reasonable — but with her performances this year, the junior has laid them to rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stefan has seized a starting role and become a consistent threat for the nationally ranked Quakers. With 15 goals and 13 assists, her diverse offensive skillset has been a tremendous help for a Penn squad one win shy of clinching its 10th Ivy title in 11 seasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Stefan to be on the field at all is a fantastic feat in its own right: for her to be one of the top offensive players on a unanimous top-10 team in the country is something else. And for that, she’s our Best Comeback Athlete.

          <p>
            After Penn football leapt from sixth to first place in 2015 in what was one of the greatest single-season turnarounds in school history in any sport, how could head coach Ray Priore top that? Maybe it wasn’t possible — but the second-year coach came pretty damn close.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, Penn did return an extremely talented team on paper, but when the team dropped its first two games, including a 28-point second half collapse at home against Lehigh, questions certainly came up about the Quakers’ ability to contend once again.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when conference play rolled around, Priore and his squad made one thing clear: this culture change is no fluke.
          </p>
          <p>
            And after a tough 28-0 loss to Princeton put the team on the brink of elimination, the team’s response was one for the record books. Players would've had an excuse to be distracted on the evening of the infamous “Racist GroupMe” scandal, but Priore kept his players' focus on nothing but the men across from them, orchestrating a 27-14 upset of then-unbeaten Harvard to vault the Red and Blue back to the top.
          </p>
          <p>
            Was this year’s success as unexpected as that of 2015? Candidly, no, but there’s a certain respect for the ability to go back-to-back — it’s a lot easier to find that extra motivation when a team is starting from the bottom. And as the first coach to win Ivy titles in each of his first two seasons in north of 40 years, Priore is a fine choice as our Best Coach.
