            Sports are about passion — the ability to risk it all, to become emotionally invested, to be a part of a team, and to test the limits of what you’re capable of. DP Sports provides the structure and guidance you need to explore that passion.

          <p>
            Our department is a place where anyone can feel welcome and be a part of the family. We spend valuable time with each and every person on our team to ensure that they can sharpen their storytelling and investigative skills. We’re a team, and we have an amazing time going on road trips, throwing watch parties, and getting immersed in the sports we cover and watch.

          <p>
            So if you like watching, playing, reading, writing, talking, photographing, or learning about sports, DP Sports is totally the place for you. No experience necessary; absolutely anyone is welcome to join!
